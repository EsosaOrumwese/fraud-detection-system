Fair point — I shouldn’t have overwritten our base. Here’s the **merged, final** Minor resolution that keeps everything from our original (scope + acceptance checks) and **adds** the extra specificity from the “correct stuff” (the canonical envelope list + flat-record note).

# Minor-01 — Envelope vs payload wording for `merchant_id` (grouping only)

## Normative rule (final)

* The **shared RNG envelope** for every S2 event contains **only lineage/counter/stream keys**:

  ```
  ts_utc, seed, parameter_hash, manifest_fingerprint, run_id,
  module, substream_label,
  rng_counter_before_lo, rng_counter_before_hi,
  rng_counter_after_lo,  rng_counter_after_hi,
  blocks (uint64), draws ("uint128-dec")
  ```
* **`merchant_id` is not part of the envelope.** It is an **event-specific field** and therefore belongs in the **payload** of the same flat JSON record.
* The record remains a **single flat object** (envelope fields + payload fields in one JSON row); “envelope” and “payload” are conceptual groupings only (no nesting).

## Scope of applicability (from our base, retained)

* **S2.9 (“Envelope (must on every row)”):** **remove `merchant_id`** from the envelope list; keep it only in each stream’s **payload** list.
* **S2.5 (“RNG envelope (from S0 infra)” & “Payload (must)”):** **no change**; it already reflects the correct split and remains the canonical pattern.

## Definitions & notes (retained)

* Path↔embed equality and partitioning apply **only** to `{seed, parameter_hash, run_id}`; `merchant_id` is **not** a path key and appears **only** in payload. *(No schema change; types/domains for `merchant_id` unchanged.)*

## Acceptance criteria (retained + tightened)

1. Nowhere in S2 is `merchant_id` listed inside the **Envelope**; it appears **only** in **Payload**.
2. All envelope inventories in S2 include **exactly** the keys above (including `blocks` and `draws`).
3. All examples remain a **single flat JSON object**; no nested “envelope” object and no duplication of `merchant_id`.

This keeps our original intent and adds the precise envelope enumeration so the fix is unambiguous.
