Here are the **16 Critical-class issues** in `state.1A.s2.expanded.txt`, each tied to the exact S2 spot and the binding S0/S1 authority it violates.

1. **Counters = draws (wrong law, per-event).**
   S2 states `after = before + draws` per event; S0’s law is **`blocks = after − before`** and **`draws` = uniforms used (independent)**.

2. **Counters = draws (wrong law, “Trace rule”).**
   S2’s “Trace rule” again asserts `draws = (after − before)` (normative).

3. **Counters = draws (wrong law, in pseudocode).**
   S2 pseudocode says “`draws` computed as the 128-bit delta.”

4. **Lane policy mis-specified globally.**
   S2: “One counter increment ⇒ one uniform; do not reuse Philox’s spare lane.” This forbids Box–Muller’s **two uniforms from one block**.

5. **u01 mapping wrong (forbidden formulation).**
   S2 uses $u=(x+1)/(2^{64}+1)$; S0 mandates `((x+1) * 0x1.0000000000000p-64)` and forbids computing `1/(2^64+1)` at runtime/decimals.

6. **u01 mapping missing the 1.0 clamp.**
   S2 omits the required `if u==1.0 then u := 1−2^-53` remap.

7. **Numeric profile drift (FMA allowed).**
   S2 permits fused operations for link evaluation; S0.8 requires **binary64, RNE, FMA off, no FTZ/DAZ**.

8. **RNG envelope field list omits mandatory fields.**
   S2’s “RNG envelope (from S0 infra)” lists fields but **omits `blocks` and `draws`**, which are mandated on every RNG event.

9. **Normative nb\_final example: missing `blocks`.**
   The example lacks `blocks:uint64` (required).

10. **Normative nb\_final example: missing `draws`.**
    The example lacks `draws:"uint128-dec"` (required).

11. **Normative nb\_final example: wrong `ts_utc` precision.**
    Shows `"…19.481Z"` (3 dp); must be **exactly 6 fractional digits**.

12. **Normative nb\_final example: `seed` is a string/UUID.**
    Must be a **JSON integer (uint64)** per envelope schema.

13. **Normative nb\_final example: `run_id` not hex32.**
    Shows an ISO-like string; must be **hex32**.

14. **Normative nb\_final example: counter words emitted as strings.**
    `rng_counter_*` must be **uint64 numbers**, not strings.

15. **Normative nb\_final example: hashes not hex64.**
    `parameter_hash` / `manifest_fingerprint` shown as truncated with ellipses; must be full **hex64**.

16. **Abort semantics vs emission order (self-contradiction).**
    S2 says on `ERR_S2_NUMERIC_INVALID` **no S2 events should exist** for that merchant, yet the S2.3 pseudocode **emits `gamma_component` before** checking `λ` and raising the error.

These are the full set of **Critical** defects for this S2 snapshot relative to your frozen S0/S1 and layer schema.
