* 6:10pm
   - Added data-intake guides for segment 6B (first commit introducing guide files).

* 6:31pm
   - Updated `amount_model_6B_authoring-guide.md` to require sealed `mlr.1A.cache.merchant_currency` and fail closed if missing.
   - Wired `mlr.1A.cache.merchant_currency` into `mlr.6B.s2.event_stream_baseline` dependencies in `artefact_registry_6B.yaml`.
   - Broke the 6B S0 circular dependency by removing `mlr.6B.validation.s0_gate_receipt` from `mlr.6B.validation.sealed_inputs` dependencies.
   - Registered `behaviour_prior_pack_6B` as a sealed input in 6B registry/dictionary/schema (contract alignment fix).
   - Cleaned 6B behaviour priors/config guides: renamed the behaviour priors guide to 6B naming and hardened the behaviour_config schema requirement to fail closed.

* 11:21pm
   - Tailored the placeholder-resolution sections for 5A and 5B authoring guides to call out specific keys and final values (policies, grids, routing, RNG budgets, validation thresholds).

* 11:28pm
   - Tailored placeholder-resolution sections across 1A/2B/3A/3B guides to specify concrete keys, required fields, and default resolutions (schemas, policies, RNG/keying, and dependency references).

* 11:58pm
   - Added placeholder-resolution sections to remaining guides (1A ccy_smoothing_params, crossborder_hyperparams, dirichlet_alpha_policy, hurdle_simulation.priors, license_map, mcc_canonical_vintage, policy.s3.base_weight, policy.s3.thresholds, transaction_schema_merchant_ids, tz_world_2025a, validation_policy; 2A tz_nudge, tz_overrides, tzdb_release; 3B cdn_weights_ext_yaml, hrsl_raster, pelias_cached.sqlite, virtual_settlement_coords; 5A scenario_calendar; 6B sessionisation; deprecated offline training note).
   - Standardized validation checklist headings in select guides (2A merchant_mcc_map, 3B hrsl_raster/pelias, 3B virtual_settlement_coords).
   - Updated `scratch_files/scratch.md` status list to mark all guides OK.
