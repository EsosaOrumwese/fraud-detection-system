   - Late log: created guide_order.txt stubs in all segment data-intake folders (1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B).
   - Late log: updated layer intake AGENTS to require verifying/creating evidence.md and daily logbook before starting work.
   - Note: this entry is recorded late; earlier logbook updates were missed and are corrected here.

* 2:47am
   - Checked local time to ensure logbook entries are timestamped accurately.
   - Located the closed-world conceptual design reference in `docs/references`.
   - Read the closed-world enterprise conceptual design to align platform context.
   - Read Layer-1 (1A-3B), Layer-2 (5A-5B), and Layer-3 (6A-6B) narrative docs.

   - Read all Layer-1 segment 1A data-intake guides (includes 1B intake guides housed under 1A).
   - Read Layer-1 contracts for 1A and 1B to align artefact registry, schemas, and dataset dictionary requirements.
   - Read Layer-1 expanded specs for 1A (S0-S9) and 1B (S0-S9) to establish binding state-flow requirements.
   - Acknowledged user direction to proceed sequentially from 1A through 3B; preparing to list 1A guide dependencies before authoring artefacts.

* 2:54am
   - Populated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/guide_order.txt` with dependency-ordered guides for 1A/1B intake.

* 3:14am
   - Adjusted `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/guide_order.txt` to place GDP bucket mapping before the transaction schema ingress (bootstrap depends on GDP buckets).

* 3:15am
   - Attempted to use WDI Archives (Route A) for GDP per capita; archive page returned HTTP 403, so switched to API route.
   - Deprecated existing GDP parquet to `reference/economic/world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-04-15/deprecated_gdp.parquet`.

   - Wrote `reference/layer1/transaction_schema_merchant_ids/2025-12-31/transaction_schema_merchant_ids.parquet` and provenance sidecar.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/evidence.md` with transaction schema details.

* 3:21am
   - Rewrote `config/models/hurdle/hurdle_simulation.priors.yaml` to the v1 schema (calibration, noise, clamps, MCC ranges, dispersion MOM).
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/evidence.md` to capture the priors update.

* 3:22am
   - Snag: existing hurdle training export code (`packages/engine/src/engine/training/hurdle/exports.py`) does not emit the required v1 keys (dict_dev5, design orders, manifest metadata) from the updated guide.
   - Attempted resolution: inspected training code; requires engine code changes to align with new bundle contract, which is out of scope without explicit user request. Pausing hurdle_coefficients/nb_dispersion generation until directed.

* 3:23am
   - Authored numeric determinism policy at `reference/governance/numeric_policy/2025-12-31/numeric_policy.json`.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/evidence.md` with numeric policy details.

* 6:58am
   - Ran `git lfs ls-files` to verify which large assets are tracked in LFS.
   - Confirmed LFS entries include `reference/iso/iso3166_canonical/2024-12-31/iso3166.parquet`, `reference/economic/world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-04-15/gdp.parquet`, and `reference/spatial/tz_world/2025a/tz_world.parquet`.
   - Noted `reference/spatial/world_countries/2024/world_countries.parquet`, `reference/spatial/population/2025/population.tif`, `reference/industry/mcc_canonical/2025-12-31/mcc_canonical.parquet`, `reference/economic/gdp_bucket_map/2024/gdp_bucket_map.parquet`, and `reference/layer1/transaction_schema_merchant_ids/2025-12-31/transaction_schema_merchant_ids.parquet` were not listed in LFS output and might need tracking.

* 7:01am
   - Staged newly created large binary artefacts (parquet/tif/zip) so they are stored as LFS pointers, including GDP buckets, MCC canonical, transaction schema merchant ids, world countries, population raster, tz_world sources, and deprecated parquet snapshots.
   - Re-ran git lfs ls-files to confirm the new large assets appear in LFS tracking.
