* 7:27am
   - Added `validation_passed_flag_1A` to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml`.
   - Added `validation_passed_flag_1A` to `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml` and `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1B/layer1.1B.yaml` to formalize the `_passed.flag` gate.
   - Set the schema anchor for `validation_passed_flag_1A` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/artefact_registry_1A.yaml`.

* 7:50am
   - Standardized `_passed.flag` references across design/spec docs (removed placeholder suffixes like `_passed.flag_*`).
   - Updated 3B S0 docs to use `validation_passed_flag_seg` placeholders and fixed the 6B S0 note to call out `_passed.flag` explicitly.

* 7:53am
   - Replaced `validation_passed_flag_seg` placeholder with `validation_passed_flag_<SEG>` in design/spec docs.

* 8:31am
   - Pinned deterministic overlap sampling in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5A/scenario_calendar_5A_derivation-guide.md`.

* 3:03pm
   - Pinned HYBRID routing to always emit `arrival_site_pick` for the coin flip and added the corresponding fail-closed rule in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_routing_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Updated S4 RNG emission order to align with HYBRID site-pick usage in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_rng_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Made 2B PASS gating conditional on physical routing in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/validation_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Pinned bounded Poisson sampling and a single-uniform gamma approximation in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_count_config_5B_authoring-guide.md`.

* 3:38pm
   - Aligned `arrival_rng_policy_5B` count-law IDs to `{poisson, nb2}`.
   - Clarified conditional 2B gating in `validation_policy_5B` upstream PASS requirements.

* 3:47pm
   - Added `erfinv` to the pinned function list in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/math_profile_manifest_authoring-guide.md`.

* 4:55pm
   - Standardized Layer-3 manifest_key naming and S0 gate dependencies in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/artefact_registry_6A.yaml` and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/artefact_registry_6B.yaml`.
   - Added first-class 6A prior/taxonomy artefacts to the 6A registry and dictionary, with schema anchors in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/schemas.6A.yaml`.
   - Added `parameter_hash` partitions to 6A/6B path templates and dictionary partitioning for seed-scoped outputs, and updated 6B scenario dataset versions.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/state-flow/6B/state.6B.s5.expanded.md` to reference `mlr.6B.validation.passed`.

* 5:11pm
   - Added 6B policy/config inputs as first-class artefacts in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/artefact_registry_6B.yaml`.
   - Added matching policy/config datasets to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/dataset_dictionary.layer3.6B.yaml`.

* 6:05pm
   - Added 6A fraud-role taxonomy and S5 validation policy as sealed inputs in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/artefact_registry_6A.yaml` and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/dataset_dictionary.layer3.6A.yaml`.
   - Added schema anchors for `fraud_role_taxonomy_6A` and `validation_policy_6A` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/schemas.6A.yaml`.
   - Wired S0 gate + sealed_inputs + fraud-role taxonomy + validation policy dependencies for all S5 fraud-role tables in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/artefact_registry_6A.yaml`.

* 6:07pm
   - Added fraud-role taxonomy and validation policy dependencies to `mlr.6A.validation.bundle` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/artefact_registry_6A.yaml` for clearer lineage.
