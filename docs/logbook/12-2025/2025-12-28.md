* 7:27am
   - Added `validation_passed_flag_1A` to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml`.
   - Added `validation_passed_flag_1A` to `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml` and `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1B/layer1.1B.yaml` to formalize the `_passed.flag` gate.
   - Set the schema anchor for `validation_passed_flag_1A` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/artefact_registry_1A.yaml`.

* 7:50am
   - Standardized `_passed.flag` references across design/spec docs (removed placeholder suffixes like `_passed.flag_*`).
   - Updated 3B S0 docs to use `validation_passed_flag_seg` placeholders and fixed the 6B S0 note to call out `_passed.flag` explicitly.

* 7:53am
   - Replaced `validation_passed_flag_seg` placeholder with `validation_passed_flag_<SEG>` in design/spec docs.

* 8:31am
   - Pinned deterministic overlap sampling in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5A/scenario_calendar_5A_derivation-guide.md`.

* 3:03pm
   - Pinned HYBRID routing to always emit `arrival_site_pick` for the coin flip and added the corresponding fail-closed rule in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_routing_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Updated S4 RNG emission order to align with HYBRID site-pick usage in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_rng_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Made 2B PASS gating conditional on physical routing in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/validation_policy_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Pinned bounded Poisson sampling and a single-uniform gamma approximation in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/data-intake/5B/arrival_count_config_5B_authoring-guide.md`.
