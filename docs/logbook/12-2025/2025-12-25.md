* 4:25am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/hurdle_simulation.priors_authoring-guide.md` to add the dispersion.mom knobs (epsilon/n_min/cell_weight_rule), pin additive mcc_offsets semantics, and require the mom block in the schema + example.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/nb_dispersion_coefficients_authoring-guide.md` to fix the phi>0 typo, bind MOM knobs + clamps to priors, pin grouping to (mcc, channel, gdp_bucket), and document deterministic pooling + weight-rule usage.

* 4:36am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/hurdle_coefficients_authoring-guide.md` to pin the mean-matrix training subset to `y_hurdle == 1` (multi-site only).
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/nb_dispersion_coefficients_authoring-guide.md` to pin the training subset to `y_hurdle == 1` and bind MOM knobs/clamps to explicit priors paths (decision-free).

* 5:05am
   - Tightened acquisition guides to remove remaining decision points: WDI GDP archive selection + fail-closed coverage, deterministic Jenks tie-break and `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` coverage check, pinned NoData handling for population raster, and updated world_countries licensing note.
   - Pinned MCC canonical scope and routing: ISO-only scope, strict enforcement against `transaction_schema_merchant_ids`, Citi PDF fallback, and clarified cross-check routes + naming.
   - Made `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` MCC/country missing handling decision-free (drop merchants on invalid/missing values).

* 5:12am
   - Added Route B bootstrap-config authority to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/transaction_schema_merchant_ids_acquisition-guide.md`, including binding config path, fail-closed rule, deterministic authoring steps, and provenance capture of config bytes/version.

* 5:50am
   - Added `config/ingress/transaction_schema_merchant_ids.bootstrap.yaml` and registered it in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/artefact_registry_1A.yaml` (including dependency wiring for `transaction_schema_merchant_ids`).
   - Added schema anchor `schemas.layer1.yaml#/policy/transaction_schema_merchant_ids_bootstrap_policy` and updated S0 manifest-fingerprint inputs to include dependency closure (S0.2.3).
