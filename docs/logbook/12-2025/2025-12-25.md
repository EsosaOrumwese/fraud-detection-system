   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/hurdle_simulation.priors_authoring-guide.md` to add the dispersion.mom knobs (epsilon/n_min/cell_weight_rule), pin additive mcc_offsets semantics, and require the mom block in the schema + example.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/1A/nb_dispersion_coefficients_authoring-guide.md` to fix the phi>0 typo, bind MOM knobs + clamps to priors, pin grouping to (mcc, channel, gdp_bucket), and document deterministic pooling + weight-rule usage.
