### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:27am
   - Updated 3A contracts to add upstream PASS flags to `s0_gate_receipt_3A` dependencies, correct the outlet_catalogue manifest key, and align the 3A PASS flag registry entry to `_passed.flag_3A`.
   - Aligned 3A plan schema and dictionaries so `s1_escalation_queue` uses `fingerprint` (not `manifest_fingerprint`) in partition keys/columns.

* 12:41am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/3A/state.3A.s1.expanded.md` to use `fingerprint` (not `manifest_fingerprint`) in S1 partition key language, required columns, and dictionary examples.
   - Expanded `validation_bundle_3A` dependencies and clarified the PASS-flag role text in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/artefact_registry_3A.yaml`.

* 1:05am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/3A/zone_mixture_policy_3A.md` to fix the artefact name and pin the deterministic `u_det` hash law.
   - Tightened `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/3A/country_zone_alphas_3A.md` to require `alpha > 0.0` and clarified NoData handling.
   - Added a non-zero floor mass safeguard in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/3A/zone_floor_policy_3A.md`.

* 6:48pm
   - Aligned 3B dataset dictionary Pelias entry to `pelias_cached_sqlite` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3B.yaml` and `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_3B/layer1.3B.yaml`.
   - Corrected 3B artefact registry schema refs for virtual policies, settlement coords, and HRSL raster, and fixed unintended schema drift on 1A/2A passed-flag entries in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` and `contracts/artefact_registry_3B.yaml`.
