* 1:00am
   - Added `cdn_weights_ext_yaml` to 3B reference data in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3B.yaml` and `contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_3B/layer1.3B.yaml`.
   - Updated the 3B artefact registry entries for the raw CDN weights input and added a schema anchor in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` and `contracts/artefact_registry_3B.yaml`.
   - Added the `cdn_weights_ext_yaml_v1` reference schema to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/schemas.3B.yaml`.

* 1:48am
   - Relaxed the weight-sum tolerance in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/3B/cdn_country_weights_authoring-guide.md`.
   - Pinned HRSL NoData handling to `0` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/3B/hrsl_raster-acquisition-guide.md`.

* 1:55am
   - Reverted `cdn_weights_ext_yaml` paths back to `artefacts/external/cdn_weights_ext.yaml` in 3B dictionaries and registries to undo the filename change.

* 5:54am
   - Replaced legacy 3B routing configs in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` and `contracts/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` with `route_rng_policy_v1`, `day_effect_policy_v1`, `alias_layout_policy_v1`, and `cdn_key_digest`.
   - Updated downstream dependencies to use the new policy artefacts and removed `performance_config` from `edge_sampler_metrics`.

* 6:19am
   - Added the `cdn_key_digest_v1` policy schema to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/schemas.3B.yaml`.
   - Set `pelias_cached_sqlite` schema refs to `schemas.3B.yaml#/reference/pelias_cached_bundle_v1` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` and `contracts/artefact_registry_3B.yaml`.

* 8:48pm
   - Registered `baseline_intensity_policy_5A` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/contracts/5A/dataset_dictionary.layer2.5A.yaml`.
   - Added the `baseline_intensity_policy_5A` schema anchor to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/contracts/5A/schemas.5A.yaml` and `contracts/schemas/layer2/schemas.5A.yaml`.
   - Aligned the 5A scenario calendar path in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/contracts/5A/artefact_registry_5A.yaml` to the config-root path.

* 1:28am
   - Fixed 5A S0 gate receipt dependencies to use upstream `mlr.<seg>.validation.passed` keys (keeping 3A’s `_passed.flag_3A`) in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-2/specs/contracts/5A/artefact_registry_5A.yaml` and `contracts/artefact_registry/artefact_registry_5A.yaml`.
   - Corrected 5A validation artefact dependencies to `mlr.5A.validation.bundle` in those registries.
