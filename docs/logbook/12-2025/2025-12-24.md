* 12:53am
   - Looking to remove synthetic countries from iso3166/iso_canonical, and unify them into a single canonical ISO source.
   - Reason for prior additions: synthetic pseudo-ISO codes were appended so the policy loader could accept the synthetic merchant universe (see logbook `docs/logbook/10-2025/2025-10-09.md` at 8:36am and 9:32am).

* 9:10am
   - Begun crafting guides for acquiring ingress artefacts for need for layer-1 segment 1A of the data engine (docs\model_spec\data-engine\layer-1\specs\data-intake\1A)

* 1:00pm
   - Still writing up my acquistion guides for datasets for 1A and authoring guides for configs/policies. But one thing I've noticed is that we might need to adjust our code base, especially for the policies. As some might be very different, but better, than the former half-assed ones.

* 1:34pm
   - Currently working on authoring guides for Phase D - Engine-governed policy/config packs in 1A(authored, not hunted)
      12. `numeric_policy.json`
      13. `math_profile_manifest.json`
      14. `crossborder_hyperparams.yaml`
      15. `policy.s3.rule_ladder.yaml`
      16. `config/allocation/ccy_smoothing_params.yaml`
      17. `config/allocation/s6_selection_policy.yaml`
      18. *(optional)* `policy.s3.base_weight.yaml`
      19. *(optional)* `policy.s3.thresholds.yaml`

* 4:46pm
   - Updated 1A data-intake acquisition guides: added schema anchors (GDP + settlement shares), determinism/non-degeneracy guard for GDP buckets, vintage/override notes for ccy_country_shares, realism/MCC validation guidance for transaction_schema_merchant_ids, and cleaned external links (world_countries, tz_world_2025a, population_raster_2025, mcc_canonical_vintage, world_bank_gdp_per_capita_20250415).

* 5:22pm
   - Updated S6 selection policy authoring guide to align with spec: path config/policy.s6.selection.yaml, removed scoring model, and set defaults/per_currency semantics + checklist.
   - Added schema anchor + contract-alignment note for iso_legal_tender_2024 and removed tracking params from external links.
   - Added realism/coherence constraints in crossborder_hyperparams.yaml guide, including ZTP grid sanity.
   - Added realism bars/notes in S3 rule ladder, base weight, and thresholds guides, including infeasibility sanity checks.
   - Added realism bar + non-degenerate output check to ccy_smoothing_params guide.
   - Added path_version, archive-bytes rule, and a libm self-test requirement to the math profile manifest guide.
   - Added anti-drift guidance to the numeric policy guide.

* 6:35pm
   - Updated hurdle_simulation.priors_authoring-guide.md to require calibration/noise/clamps as strict top-level keys, pin corpus generation semantics to runtime (NB2 gamma-Poisson + N>=2 rejection), define deterministic Normal noise, and add fixed calibration order.
   - Removed inconsistent target_* fields from per-block requirements and aligned schema Appendix B to include calibration/noise/clamps definitions + required list.

* 6:41pm
   - Tightened hurdle_coefficients_authoring-guide.md with exact design.beta_order / design.beta_mu_order checks, mandatory behavioural realism for production exports, explicit sha256 digest provenance, and a caution note on repo link accuracy.
   - Tightened nb_dispersion_coefficients_authoring-guide.md with pinned MOM knobs sourced from priors + manifest, corridor thresholds pinned in priors, and a corrected rho_hat formula.
