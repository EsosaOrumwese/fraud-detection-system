* 12:53am
   - Looking to remove synthetic countries from iso3166/iso_canonical, and unify them into a single canonical ISO source.
   - Reason for prior additions: synthetic pseudo-ISO codes were appended so the policy loader could accept the synthetic merchant universe (see logbook `docs/logbook/10-2025/2025-10-09.md` at 8:36am and 9:32am).

* 9:10am
   - Begun crafting guides for acquiring ingress artefacts for need for layer-1 segment 1A of the data engine (docs\model_spec\data-engine\layer-1\specs\data-intake\1A)

* 1:00pm
   - Still writing up my acquistion guides for datasets for 1A and authoring guides for configs/policies. But one thing I've noticed is that we might need to adjust our code base, especially for the policies. As some might be very different, but better, than the former half-assed ones.

* 1:34pm
   - Currently working on authoring guides for Phase D — Engine-governed policy/config packs in 1A(authored, not hunted)
