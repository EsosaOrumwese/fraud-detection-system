   - Looking to remove synthetic countries from iso3166/iso_canonical, and unify them into a single canonical ISO source.
   - Reason for prior additions: synthetic pseudo-ISO codes were appended so the policy loader could accept the synthetic merchant universe (see logbook `docs/logbook/10-2025/2025-10-09.md` at 8:36am and 9:32am).
