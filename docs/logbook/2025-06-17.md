### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:50pm
  * Started to work on adding unit tests, pre-commit hooks and CI integration for this issue before opening pull request.

* 7:41pm
  * Added in the `AIRFLOW__API__SECRET_KEY: ${SECRET_KEY:?}` field for the `airflow-apiserver` after going through the list of variables listed [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#secret-key)

* 8:16pm
  * I need to edit my `pretty-format-yaml` and `check-yaml` hooks to leave my docker-compose yaml files alone as they're linting and fixing it wrongly. e.g. changing `"8080:8080"` to `8080:8080`
  * Ran `pip freeze | grep -E 'connexion|apache|Flask'` in order to find what versions of `apache-airflow-*`, `Flask` and `connexion` I have been using in order to pin those packages in `requirements.txt`

* 9:41pm
  * Noticed that pinning the versions for `flask` and `connexion` causes the `apiserver` to not come online due to some files missing basically incompatibility of the packages and `apache-airflow`
    * Found a list of their constraints for python 3.11 on their [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.2/constraints-3.11.txt)
  * Looks like I'll have to drop down to Python 3.9 for this as the above link points to their `v3-0-test` branch and it still uses Python 3.9. 
    * However, I'll still use Python 3.11 since 3.9 will reach its end of life in October this year, but I'll switch to the `main` branch and copy the constraints from [there](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.9.txt)
    * Sticking with 3.11 shouldn't be a problem though as stated [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements)

* 10:05pm
  * Tested workflow and everything is squeaky clean, healthy and runs fine. 

* 10:45pm
  * Time to merge with `dev`, push to `origin/dev` and open Pull Request to main
  * Test failed. Changes made to fix 
    * Add orchestration/airflow/scripts/bootstrap.sh step to CI lint and test jobs to generate required FERNET_KEY/SECRET_KEY before running Compose or hooks 
    * Wrap `set -o pipefail` in a Bash-only guard in nuke.sh/bootstrap.sh for POSIX `sh` compatibility 
    * Update .pre-commit-config.yaml to exclude docs/references and orchestration/airflow/config/airflow.cfg from detect-secrets scans
