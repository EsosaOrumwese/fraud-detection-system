### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 7:15pm
  * Fix errors in `test_core_risk` that asserted the wrong dtype for `int` variables. Also replaced deprecated none existent method for checking equality of two dataframes with `df1.to_pandas().equals(df2.to_pandas())`
  * Fix error in `test_catalog_risk` which expected `.inner` in the already exposed columns
  * Changed the uuid generator from `uuid.uuid4.hex` to faker's uuid generator since at each call a new uuid was generated despite my seed, making it difficult to handle reproducibility. 
  * Silenced `DeprecationWarning: In future, it will be an error for 'np.bool_' scalars to be interpreted as an index` by adding suppression in `pytest.ini`
