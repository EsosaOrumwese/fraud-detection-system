* 5:05pm
  * Realized that my `daily_cost.yml` workflow failed due to `Error: Could not assume role with OIDC: No OpenIDConnect provider found in your account for https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
  * Decided to go through this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/) to figure out how to resolve it before continuing with issue `DAT-01`.
    * To create an OIDC-trusted connection that is scoped to an individual GitHub repository, and how to map the repository to an IAM role in your account. 
    * This post focuses on creating an IAM OIDC identity provider for GitHub and demonstrates how to authorize access into an AWS account from a specific branch and repository. 
    * Attached the `AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess`
      * ```aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess```
