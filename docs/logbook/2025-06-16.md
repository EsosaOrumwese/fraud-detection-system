* 5:57pm
  * My `test_nuke.py` all of a sudden started failing and after some help, I found out that it was because it was calling `bash` for the shell script and not `sh`. 
  * Here's the reason
    On Windows, when you do:
    
    ```python
    subprocess.run(["bash", "infra/scripts/nuke.sh", …])
    ```
    
    you’re explicitly launching the **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) “bash” executable. Every time your test spins up a new `bash` process, Windows has to boot or wake up that tiny Linux VM/container via the HCS service—and sometimes it just isn’t ready in time, leading to the `HCS_E_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` you saw.
    
    By contrast, the `sh` you get in a Git-for-Windows (MSYS) environment is a **native** POSIX-compatible shell that lives entirely in user-mode on Windows. It doesn’t spin up any VM or container—so it starts almost instantly, never times out, and happily runs your script (honoring its `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang when it sees Bash-isms).
    
    In short:
    
    * **`bash`** → routes into WSL → VM startup overhead → occasional timeouts.
    * **`sh`** → MSYS shell built into Git-for-Windows → zero VM overhead → rock-solid startup.
    
    That’s why swapping `["bash", …]` for `["sh", …]` in your test immediately fixed the timeout, even though the script itself still requires Bash under the hood.
  * What is left to finish out this issue:
    * Add test, pre-commit and CI integration
    * Finish with all tests on CI green ✅
