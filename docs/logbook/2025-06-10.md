* 3:43pm
  * Began work on OPS-02 to finish of sprint-01

* 8:23pm
  * Got the nuke shell script to work.
    * It runs a dry nuke and an actual tear down nuke which empties versioned buckets, 
    * destroys resources and 
    * prunes runs on MLFlow older than 7 days
  * Added a GitHub action workflow for it to be run on the UI

* 8:56pm
  * Will have to shift the nuke GitHub actions workflow to next sprint as I need to properly look at creating the required permissions for it and see how it integrates with my OIDC GitHub role all whilst ensuring it's of production quality.
    * Therefore, after adding to remote repo, I will disable `nuke.yml`

* 9:30pm
  * Ran through test and confirmed working
  * Time to push and open PR to main.
