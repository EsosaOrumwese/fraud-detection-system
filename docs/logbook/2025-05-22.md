* 7:51am
  * Began fixing any issues that'll cause my resources from spinning

* 10:12am
  * Still very much struggling with an error with `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.billing_100pct`
    * Error: creating CloudWatch Metric Alarm (fraud-sbx-billing-40gbp): operation error CloudWatch: PutMetricAlarm, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: 8a4f72e9-dda4-4256-a949-bc1e3ec82b5a, api error ValidationError: Invalid region eu-west-2 specified. Only us-east-1 is supported.
  * I have added the different providers in versions.tf and called it by its alias. Yet it is still using the default region.
  * I finally solved it! All I had to do was remove that useless `providers = aws.us` line as probably the resource already defaulted to `us-east-1`
  * Resuming correcting any security issues.

* 14:26pm
  * You wouldn't believe it but I am finally done with this issue (as per the problems surrounding it)
    * I had an issue with the kill switch, it just couldn't spin up
    * And from that issue rose many like policies needed to be hardcoded since it depended on them, on so forth.
