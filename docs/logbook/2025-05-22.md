* 7:51am
  * Began fixing any issues that'll cause my resources from spinning

* 10:12am
  * Still very much struggling with an error with `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.billing_100pct`
    * Error: creating CloudWatch Metric Alarm (fraud-sbx-billing-40gbp): operation error CloudWatch: PutMetricAlarm, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: 8a4f72e9-dda4-4256-a949-bc1e3ec82b5a, api error ValidationError: Invalid region eu-west-2 specified. Only us-east-1 is supported.
  * I have added the different providers in versions.tf and called it by its alias. Yet it is still using the default region.
  * I finally solved it! All I had to do was remove that useless `providers = aws.us` line as probably the resource already defaulted to `us-east-1`
  * Resuming correcting any security issues.

* 2:26pm
  * You wouldn't believe it, but I am finally done with this issue (as per the problems surrounding it)
    * I had an issue with the kill switch, it just couldn't spin up
    * And from that issue rose many like policies needed to be hardcoded since it depended on them, on so forth.

* 3:23pm
  * Commit changes to origin/dev however failed lint test due to error in function call `47: source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("lambda/cost_kill.zip") # created below`
    * Advised to handle it with terraform instead
  * Summary of accomplishments
    - Tighten IAM policies (no wildcards, scoped SageMaker & Logs ARNs)
    - Add SQS DLQ permissions and enable SSE on DLQ
    - Remove unused VPC config & security group for Lambda
    - Restrict SG egress to AWS service prefix lists over HTTPS
    - Simplify CloudWatch alarm region handling (use default `eu-west-2`)
    - Update Makefile for flexible alarm-test with AWS_REGION/ALARM_NAME
    - Confirm SNS email subscription requirement documented
  * Once lint test is solved, and ci passed, review code for more understanding of what's going on.

* 11:53pm:
  * Fixed CI issue by building lambda package before terraform validation
    - Add step to CI workflow to zip `lambda/index.py` into `infra/terraform/lambda/cost_kill.zip`
    - Ensures `filebase64sha256()` finds the artifact during terraform validate
