### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 7:50pm
  * I have been struggling with trying to understand the code for Prefect to be able to fix the errors on it, but it proved difficult because it was just new to me and there wasn't that much beginner-friendly help on slack.
  * Decision was to switch from Prefect to the well known industry standard, Apache Airflow and MLFlow. Might cost money but it's better and stands out better on a resume that Prefect which can be learnt later.
  * Also decided to backlog the level-up extras for this issue as I am way behind my sprint deadline.
    * I will commit my current state but then remove all the level-up related files.
    * ADR-0006 also reflects this.

* 8:04pm:
  * Removed `prefect` and `duckdb` from `pyproject.toml`
  * Added code explanation to `./docs/references`
