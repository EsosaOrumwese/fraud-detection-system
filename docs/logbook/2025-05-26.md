* 6:20pm
  * Resumed understanding how my data schema should be built.
  * Added and committed ADR-0003 to ADR-0005. 

* 7:42pm
  * Began unit tests for `yaml` schema.
  * Ran into an issue with my use of `pytest` fixtures. I called a fixture (`spec()`) directly and that was flagged by `pytest`.
  * Generated the markdown data dictionary from schema
  * Added pre-commit yaml lint to `pre-commit-config.yaml` and added `yamllint` package to `poetry`
  * Added `great-expectations` to help ensure data quality.
    * Still trying to get it to work

* 10:20pm
  * I'll be skipping `great_expectations` as I just can't get it to work in my CLI.
  * Started working on the Merchant Category Table
