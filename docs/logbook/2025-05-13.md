### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 8:00am
  * Trying to understand the difference between what is required in OPS-01 and what I did in `ci.yml` for `REP-02` (refer to `Sprint-01.md`)
  * Updated summary notes so that it outlines the goal for each issue. Started working on summary note for issue OPS-01.
  * Stopped at comparing and understanding the research approach towards solving this issue and the improvements made to the `ci.yml` file.
    * Understand exactly how we arrived at this stage,
    * How the checklist for the deliverables can be solved
    * Why it is necessary for our CI
    
* 7:30pm
  * Understood the intent behind why we wanted to improve `ci.yml` for this issue. Refer to summary notes for OPS-01 in `./docs/references/`
  * Began implementing the changed for this issue.
  * Updated `ci.yml` and ready to commit and test.

Reflections after working on this issue
  * What benefit does a coverage threshold give compared to “just run tests”?
    * A threshold enforces a minimum percentage of code exercised by tests—so you catch untested logic early, not just pass/fail status.
  * Why might you split lint and test into separate jobs later?
    * Running them in parallel gives faster feedback and isolates failures (you immediately know whether it’s a style issue or a test failure).
  * What’s the trade-off of adding more Python versions to the matrix?
    * You gain confidence across environments at the cost of longer CI run times and more compute usage.
  * How would you cache Terraform plugins in a future workflow?
    * Use `actions/cache` on your Terraform plugin directory (e.g. `~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache` or `.terraform/plugins`), keying off OS and `.tf` files, so subsequent runs skip redownloading providers.
  

* 9:00 pm
  * Push to remote repo and failed lint test. Issue due to poetry lock being out of sync with `pyproject.toml`
  * This was because I changed the required version for Python from >=3.12 to >=3.11
