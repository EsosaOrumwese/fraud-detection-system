* 5:00pm
  * Started watching Travis Media's [AWS Networking Basics For Programmers | Hands On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doSoMN2xvI&list=WL&index=3) on YT
  * Moved to his video on [Why You NEED To Learn Terraform | Practical Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvNqfgojocs&list=WL&index=3)
  * Got to see what the different files in terraform are for.

* 6:47pm
  * Realized that my current code doesn't meet the requirements of the issue plan. 
    * The sandbox only has a VPC and 2 S3 buckets.
    * It doesn't have an IGW (internet gateway), no public subnet, no route table or tables connections.
  * I'll have to start again but happy that I know where the issue is and what to look out for to fix it.
