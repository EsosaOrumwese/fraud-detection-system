* 9:25am
  * Decided to refactor the code once more, placing more emphasis on my microservice layout.
  * Task now is to properly understand what this issue is about and how to achieve it before going ahead with the code. 
    * At the moment, I don't have a clue what "orchestration" is

* 10:15am
  * Realized that having `python` and not `python3` in my local dev might cause issues now that I'm containerizing with docker as some runners might need `python3` to be called explicitly.
    * Also added the `C:\Users\LEGION\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312` to my System PATH
  * Need to change my scripts to now call `python3` instead
