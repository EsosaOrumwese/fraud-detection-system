* 7:55am
  * Still fiddling with `pyproject.toml` and `Dockerfile`
  * Set my Dockerfile to build with Python 3.12
  * My code currently fails because of build context. I need to fix that
    * Try to answer my question giving the context of Airflow-Docker constraint, project file structure, Dockerfile V3 constraint

  * 8:27pm
    * Edited the Dockerfile and `docker-compose` to use my repo-root as a build context just so I can copy in and install `src`, `infra/terraform` and `great_expectations`
    * I need to really sort out the scripts in `scripts/` to their respective folder without breaking the whole code.
      * Also need a way to bootstrap my aws credentials into `.env` during its creation so that it's not hardcoded.
    * Find out what this `COMPOSE_BAKE` means and does;
       ```
       $ make airflow-build
       Rebuilding your custom image...
       Compose can now delegate builds to bake for better performance.
        To do so, set COMPOSE_BAKE=true.

      ```

* 10:16pm
  * Images build properly, containers spin up properly and are healthy
  * Dag runs well
    * However, I need to add a tag to the image built so it doesn't just get `latest`
  * Next, understand completely what was done in this issue.
