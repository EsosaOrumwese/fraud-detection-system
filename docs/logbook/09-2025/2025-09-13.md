* 5:24am
  * Solving critical batch-2 issues
  * Resolved batch 2 critical issues in the state-2 expanded doc

* 6:29am
  * feat(1A/S2): close Critical #1–#16 — RNG/accounting, lanes, u01, envelope, nb\_final, emit-after-guard
    * **What changed (critical fixes, fully applied to `state.1A.s2.expanded`):**
      * **Per-event law (#1):** bind counters to **blocks** and keep **draws** independent (uniforms used). Rewrote S2.6 per-event rule; removed any “`draws = after−before`” guidance; aligned S2.3 comments and S2.5 example language.
      * **Trace totals (#2):** trace now holds **cumulative** `blocks_total = Σ blocks_event` and `draws_total = Σ draws_event`; counters certify **blocks only**.
      * **Pseudocode derivation (#3):** `draws` comes from sampler budgets, **never** from counter deltas; updated reference notes.
      * **Lane policy (#4):** single-uniform uses **x0** and **discards x1**; Box–Muller consumes **both lanes from one block**; **no caching** across events. Ref impl updated to block-indexed helpers; removed high-lane cache.
      * **u01 mapping & clamp (#5, #6):** use the **binary64 hex literal** `0x1.0000000000000p-64`; added strict-open-interval clamp (`u==1.0 → 0x1.fffffffffffffp-1`) in text and helper.
      * **Numeric policy (#7):** removed permissive “fused ops” wording; require **S0.8** (binary64, RNE, **FMA-OFF**, no FTZ/DAZ, fixed-order **Neumaier**).
      * **Envelope completeness (#8):** envelope inventories now explicitly include **`blocks (uint64)`** and **`draws ("uint128-dec")`**; envelope/payload split preserved.
      * **`nb_final` example hygiene (#9–#15):** fixed to be schema-true:
        `ts_utc` RFC-3339 with **6 dp**; `seed` **uint64** (int); `run_id` **hex32**; `rng_counter_*` **uint64** numbers; `parameter_hash` & `manifest_fingerprint` **hex64**; **non-consuming** envelope → `"blocks": 0`, `"draws": "0"`.
      * **Abort semantics (#16):** **emit after guard** — draw Γ, compute/guard λ, **no events on abort**; only then emit `gamma_component`, followed by `poisson_component`; `nb_final` remains non-consuming.
    * **Assurance:**
      * No schema/partition/path changes; no S0/S1 drift; examples are schema-true.
      * Grep/coverage checks: no “one increment ⇒ one uniform”, no `(x+1)/(2^64+1)`, no “draws = after−before”; lane caching removed; clamp present.
    * **What remains (Major/High, tracked next):**
      * Replace “**interleave by time/counter**” with **counter-interval pairing only** (strict lexicographic order on `rng_counter_before` and ordering constraint); confirm `index=0` semantics for NB Gamma are documented as a **scalar placeholder** (if not already).

* 9:30am
  * feat(1A/S2): close Major/High set — counter-interval pairing; registry-closed module literals; `index=0` semantics
    * What changed (Major/High):
      * Pairing rule (validator + KATs + notes): Remove all time/file-order phrasing; pairing is now solely by counter intervals with the ordering constraint
        `u128(before)_Γ[t] < u128(after)_Γ[t] ≤ u128(before)_Π[t] < u128(after)_Π[t]`.
        Added explicit “No reliance on time/file order.” across validator replay step, reference algorithm, KATs, and S2.4 notes.&#x20;
      * Component metadata alignment: Pin `module` literals to registry-closed values (data dictionary) everywhere S2 mentions `module` (normative text, pseudocode envelopes, examples, and retention/lineage recap):
        `gamma_component` → `"1A.nb_and_dirichlet_sampler"`,
        `poisson_component` → `"1A.nb_poisson_component"`,
        `nb_final` → `"1A.nb_sampler"`.
        Removed any `1A.nb_*` placeholders and single-literal assumptions; added a one-line authority pointer to the dictionary.&#x20;
      * Index semantics (NB Gamma): Added binding one-liner: for `gamma_component (context="nb")` the Gamma is scalar per attempt; `index` is fixed `0` (scalar placeholder), not a selector.&#x20;
    * Why this matters:
      * Eliminates any chance of divergent attempt pairing under concurrency (order-invariant by counters).
      * Keeps S2’s producer metadata in perfect lockstep with the governed dictionary (no drift between spec and lineage).
      * Removes implementer guesswork around `index`.
    * Assurance (no regressions):
      * Critical set (#1–#16) remains intact: per-event law (blocks vs draws), cumulative trace totals, lane policy (BM = 2-from-1, no caching), u01 hex-literal + clamp, emit-after-guard, envelope completeness, and non-consuming `nb_final` example.
      * No new Minor/Low/Polish items introduced by these edits.
