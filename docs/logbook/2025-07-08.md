* 6:09am
  * Began working on the tests for stage 2
  * Test added and passed successfully, on to the next stage.

* 6:45pm
  * Skipped stage 3 as there was no point adding that much complexity. At the moment, my `NumPy` implementation of `sample_entities` works just fine.
    * **Catalogs are built once** (v2) and injected into every worker via a picklable initializer.
    * **Chunk loop** now reuses those in-memory catalogs in both multi- and single-proc modes.
    * **Entity sampling** stays on the battle-tested NumPy path (since Polars 1.30.0 has no weighted-sampling API), which is just as fast for your small catalogs.

* 7:27pm
  * Begin working on stage 4
    *
