### Issues Resolved: [IAC-01](https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/issues/4) `in-progress`
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 8:00am
  * Began reading documentations on VPC
  * Began going through the tutorials on Hashicorp's Terraform [website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) to install Terraform and Docker (WSL first)

* 11:00am
  * Decided to finish the tutorial first, and since I have a rough background on Terraform and AWS (at least the components for this project), begin working on this issue. I can read deeply later on.

* 2:31pm
  * Began creating a new IAM user with programmatic access and with the least privileges for accessing and controlling E2 and S3

* 4:00pm
  * Finally created an IAM user (`fraud-dev`) and configured CLI. Let's sort this issue out quickly!

* 7:12pm
  * Set up my .tf files, ran `terraform init` -> `terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars -out=tfplan`
  * But at the apply stage, I ran into errors due to my IAM user not having the permissions required to carry out the task.
  * I'm looking at how to create a trail using CloudTrail on AWS, run a golden run i.e. have an IAM user with enough permissions and then track the permissions that are needed before redefining my policy once again.
