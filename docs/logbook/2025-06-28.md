### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Issues Resolved: [SD-01](https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/issues/24) `in-progress`
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 11:06am
  * Resumed working on my data generator. Created new python scripts within `src/fraud-detection/simulator`-- `core.py`, `cli.py` and reworked the `generate.py` to call from those scripts

* 12:50pm
  * Apart from minor arguments to the cli arguments for the data generator, I have also changed the way data is saved locally to mimic the way it is stored in my file directory i.e. `{out_dir}/payments/year=YYYY/month=MM/filename`. Change needs to be effect in affected files.

* 1:43pm
  * Base data generator confirmed working and produces valid data

* 4:21pm
  * Added three catalog generators (`customer`, `merchant`, `card`) with tunable Zipf exponents. As well as a generic `sample_entities(...)` that any downstream code can call to draw `N` IDs according to the catalog’s distribution.
  * Added in a pytest suite for my catalog generator that tests
    * `_zipf_weights` edge-cases and sum-to-1 
    * Catalog generators’ lengths, columns & dtypes 
    * Basic sampling correctness 
    * Statistical skew check (heavy hitters > tail)

* 4:45pm
  * Added `project_config/` to house my config files. Included the prefix `project_` to avoid clashes with Airflow's `config` file when baking it into DockerImage
    * Note, I need to add this to my image as well.
  * Add `generator_config` and `config.py`
    * A single `GeneratorConfig` model collects all knobs: row count, fraud rate, seed, catalog specs, dates, and I/O flags. 
    * Nested Pydantic models (`CatalogConfig`, `TemporalConfig`) ensure clear structure and built-in validation. 
    * A simple `load_config(path)` function reads the YAML and returns a typed object or errors fast. 
    * The YAML template shows exactly how to supply values; any missing or mistyped fields will be caught before you run generation.
  * Added `test_config` in. It passes on 6 tests but failes on 1 i.e. the `test_missing_sections`
  *
