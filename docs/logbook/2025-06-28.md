* 11:06am
  * Resumed working on my data generator. Created new python scripts within `src/fraud-detection/simulator`-- `core.py`, `cli.py` and reworked the `generate.py` to call from those scripts

* 12:50pm
  * Apart from minor arguments to the cli arguments for the data generator, I have also changed the way data is saved locally to mimic the way it is stored in my file directory i.e. `{out_dir}/payments/year=YYYY/month=MM/filename`. Change needs to be effect in affected files.

* 1:43pm
  * Base data generator confirmed working and produces valid data

* 4:21pm
  * Added three catalog generators (`customer`, `merchant`, `card`) with tunable Zipf exponents and reproducible seeds. As well as a generic `sample_entities(...)` that any downstream code can call to draw `N` IDs according to the catalog’s distribution.
