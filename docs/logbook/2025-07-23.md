* 6:17am
  * Consolidate reproducibility & configurability (subsegment 4a); close holes in manifest, RNG, CI, and validation harness
  * Summary:
    - Expanded `license_map` semantics with explicit artifact→license mapping and `validate_licences.py` enforcement.
    - Specified live manifest file path (`/tmp/build.manifest`) and exact line structure.
    - Clarified parameter‑set hash computation, dataset_root naming, and master_seed left‑shift XOR logic.
    - Formalized Philox 2¹²⁸ PRNG sub‑streams, `_jump` protocol, and comprehensive `rng_trace.log` events.
    - Inserted structural firewall checks (five vectorized validations) with reproducer script and CI abort.
    - Added geospatial conformance audit via beta‑posterior intervals and CI gating.
    - Introduced outlet‑count bootstrap procedure with 10 000 replicates, histogram envelopes, PNG diagnostics, and merge blocking.
    - Defined footfall–throughput Poisson‑GLM regression, dispersion thresholds, and CI flagging.
    - Documented multivariate indistinguishability test (XGBoost AUROC≤0.55) with fixed seeding.
    - Enumerated DST edge‑passer minute‑by‑minute validation around spring/fall transitions.
    - Integrated HashGate upload (`validation_passed=true`) and read‑only NFS dataset immutability.
    - Enforced artifact registry ordering, digest streaming, and Postgres collision‐prevention on `(parameter_hash, seed)`.
  * Breaking Changes:
    - `build.manifest` path and format updated; scripts must read `/tmp/build.manifest`.
    - New `rng_trace.log` event types and fields; audit parsers require update.
    - CI workflows now depend on new validation scripts: `firewall.py`, `geo_audit.py`, `bootstrap_validator.py`, `footfall_glm_validator.py`, `xgb_validator.py`, `dst_validator.py`, `upload_to_hashgate.py`, `validate_licences.py`.
    - Dataset directory naming embeds `parameter_hash`; old datasets will not mount under the new convention.

* 6:51pm
  * Fixed some errors in 4A files. Specify manifest writers, artifact loader, and manifest structure.
  * Summary:
    - Named `pipeline_launcher.sh` as the orchestration script writing `/tmp/build.manifest`.
    - Named `artefact_loader.py` for enumeration of `artefact_registry.yaml` entries.
    - Fixed master seed placement to line 5 of the manifest in both narrative and assumptions.
    - Named `upload_to_hashgate.py` as the HashGate upload script.
    - Added Parquet `creator_param_hash` comment insertion and RNG constructor usage to assumptions.
