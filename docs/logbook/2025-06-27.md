### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 5:05pm
  * Resumed working on improving my data generator -> `src/fraud_detection/simulator/generate.py`
  * Added in order of approach, things that need to be fixed in my data gen
  * Switch to new branch `revamp_data_generator` which will be used to hold the history of my fixes for the data-generator. Incase it crashes, I can be able to switch back to my `data-generator` branch which was created for SD-01.

* 5:23pm
  * Began to modularize and decouple for generator. Here's the improved layout
      ```{text}
      src/fraud_detection/
      ├─ simulator/
      │  ├─ catalogs/             # customer/card/merchant catalog generators
      │  │  ├─ __init__.py
      │  │  └─ entity_catalog.py
      │  ├─ transactions/         # transaction‐level logic
      │  │  ├─ __init__.py
      │  │  └─ transaction_builder.py
      │  ├─ io/                   # sinks (Parquet, S3, etc.)
      │  │  ├─ __init__.py
      │  │  └─ writer.py
      │  ├─ config.py
      │  └─ generate.py           # CLI entrypoint: wires config → catalogs → transactions → writer
      ```
  * Added code into empty modular scripts but left `generate.py` untouched before commit
