### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 1:00am
  * Working on feature engineering for my datetime column
  * Designed to expect on `datetime` column i.e. "event_time". If more should be added, then we'll need to update the code

* 10:33am
  * Resumed working on adding a helper function for extracting features from datetime into `train_baseline.py`
  * Added `DateTimeFeaturizer` class to `src/fraud_detection/utils/datetime_featurizer` incase the project grows and I have other `datetime` columns, or I need to improve feature engineering on `datetime` columns.
  * Will commit changes without running the pre-commit hooks just so I don't mess things up when trying to address the other errors that MyPy and Pytest picked up
  *
