* 9:07pm
  * My current specifications has so many flaws such that it ends up being naive. 
    * I need to 
      * rework the specifications for SD-02, 
      * research out the exact kind of logic I need to implement a synthetic multi-timezone realism and seasonality & temporal patterns,
      * before finally translating said logic into code.
  * At point of commit, Stage 6: RNG Seeding & Reproducibility is vaguely completed with most tests passing apart from some `test_temporal_*.py` tests.
    * This shows that the integrations work well, as per the tests, with other features of the generator and also the project itself like the naive model, Airflow and Docker
