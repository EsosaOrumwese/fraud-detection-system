* 7:38pm
  * Working on the extras of the issue and might give `great_expectations` another go.
  * Before that I'm trying to understand;
    * 'why' having a schema is necessary;
    * the logic behind the level-up extras and why it is needed.
  * Learnt something new, "impossible travel"
    * “Impossible travel” is one of the most basic anomaly detections used to indicate that a user is compromised. The logic behind impossible travel is simple. If the same user connects from two different countries and the time between those connections can’t be made through conventional air travel, it’s an impossible travel.4

* 8:44pm
  * Done understanding the background for this issue. Time to focus on `great_expectations`
  * After that, I'll fix the tables in my markdown files.
  * It appears that the CLI for `great_expectations` has been [deprecated](https://greatexpectations.io/blog/a-fond-farewell-to-the-cli/) as such I have to change my methodology of implementation
  *
