* 5:01pm
  * Resumed working on SD-01 which was broken down into 6 stages
    * Stage 1: Standalone Catalog Artifacts
      * _Goal_: Build and write out your three entity tables as Parquets under 5 MB each. 
      * _Deliverable_: Three size-validated Parquets in a local folder.
    * Stage 2: CLI Flag & Mode Switch
      * _Goal_: Introduce `--realism {v1,v2}` so teams can opt into Zipf-catalog sampling. 
      * _Deliverable_: Running `gen-data --realism v2` creates and uses the catalog files instead of the old logic.
    * Stage 3: Cache & Chunk-Loop Optimization
      * _Goal_: Stop rebuilding catalogs per chunk and maximize Polars parallelism. 
      * _Deliverable_: Profiling shows catalog build once, chunk sampling scales linearly with threads.
    * Stage 4: Data-Quality Fixes
      * _Goal_: Polish corner-cases so we match real-world expectations.
      * _Deliverable_: Correct, standard UUIDs; currency matches country; no slow loops remain.
    * Stage 5: Testing & Validation
      * _Goal_: Lock in correctness, skew, size, and (soft) performance guarantees in CI.
      * _Deliverable_: Green CI with clear, deterministic tests guarding SD-01’s acceptance criteria.
    * Stage 6: Documentation & Cleanup
      * _Goal_: Make SD-01 discoverable and maintainable.
      * _Deliverable_: Up-to-date docs and a lean codebase.

* 7:20pm
  * Added smoke script at the bottom of `catalog.py` so anyone can run it and verify the three Parquet catalogs get written under 5 MB.
