### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 9:44pm
  * Began attempting to fix the cause of my commit failing the CI tests
    * realized I commited my `.cfg` file which contains secrets. I had to update my `.gitignore`
    * `test_nuke` wasn't working on CI because it didn't recognize `-o pipefail` in my `nuke.sh` file. Had to make that optional
      * `infra/scripts/nuke.sh: 14: set: Illegal option -o pipefail`
    * Also noticed that my CI wasn't picking up the relative paths that I had defined in my `ci.yml` or `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. 
    * Noticed that the directories that needed to be excluded by `detect-secrets` were in the wrong format. Fixed that and updated the `.secrets.baseline`

* 10:57
  * Still struggling with `detect-secrets`
  * Fixed the issue of `docker-compose lint` not finding my file by passing `pass_filenames=False`
