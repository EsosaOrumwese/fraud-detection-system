* 10:59am
  * SD-01 is nearly complete, time to update the doc strings and also add a data dictionary.
  * (NOTE): Also, now that I upload the catalogue entities to my `fraud-artifacts-bucket`, I also need to integrate this as well as the updated realism flag into my Airflow DAG.
  * (NOTE): I generate `n_rows` UUID4 which bloats my catalogue and makes it of no use.

* 11:45am
  * Roughly updated project README
