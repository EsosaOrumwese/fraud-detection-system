  - Remove standalone `nb_mean_coefficients.yaml` references from `parameter_spec_1A.txt`
  - Extend `config/hurdle_coefficients.yaml` description to include both β (hurdle) and α (NB-mean) links
  - Update `ComputeNBParameters` `interface_contract_spec_1A.txt` to indicate `parsed_hurdle_coefficients` holds both coefficient sets
  - Amend `governing_artefacts_1A.txt`:
    • Note that `hurdle_coefficients.yaml` now contains NB-mean coefficients
    • Rename `stationarity_diagnostics.parquet` to `artefacts/diagnostics/hurdle_stationarity_tests_2024Q4.parquet`
  - Update `version_matrix_1A.toml.txt` to reflect the new path and version_tag for `hurdle_stationarity_tests`
