* 9:39am
  * Working on the prompts for catalogue finding and spec writing for each of the essential sub-layers needed for a shippable `merchant-location realism` layer
  
    | Sub-Layer                         | Initial Essential               | Can Defer | Why/When to Add                            |
    |-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Edge‑case pathways                | **YES**                         |           | Data will break without it                 |
    | Interface contracts               | **YES**                         |           | Code won’t chain or pass validation        |
    | Build reproducibility (pins/hash) | **YES**                         |           | Audit, re-run, upgrades                    |
    | Parameter priors/posteriors       | maybe (document links at least) | ✔         | Without, no explainability or retrain path |
    | Temporal version matrix           | maybe                           | ✔         | Needed for version upgrades                |
    | Runtime metrics spec              |                                 | **YES**   | SRE/integration only                       |
    | Data-retention & purge rules      |                                 | **YES**   | Ops/compliance only                        |
    | Licence ledgers                   |                                 | **YES**   | Legal/compliance/third-party audit         |


* 12:56pm
  * Begun ensuring that my Appendix A (Mathematics) and Appendix B (Artefacts Registry) fully reflect all the information stated in the assumptions.txt and narrative.txt for each section
    * After that, we'll be set to begin running the specification prompts on the docs.

* 3:31pm
  * Appendix A and B now reflect, to a good degree, all the information stated in the assumption and narrative texts for each subsegment.

* 5:51pm
  * Started working on the CF-SW for the first sub-layer, Edge-case pathways

* 7:15pm
  * Decided to scrap using the prompts in `docs/prompt_engr/model_spec/data-gen/prompts/transition_from_narrative_shippable_product.md` as they might be limiting to the model but I'll extract the information from it.
    * I feel the mistake I made when crafting it was asking the model to tailor it to Hole Finder and Hole Fixer. Those prompts had different objects from this.

* 7:30pm
  * Decided to continue using the prompts as specific instructions is what I needed.

* 10:28pm
  * Complete parameter priors/posteriors catalogue & spec for merchant-location realism layer
    - Exhaustively extracted and documented all stochastic parameters, hyper-parameters, priors, thresholds, and policy constants for every subsegment (1A–4B)
    - Produced gap-free `parameter_catalogue.txt` and `parameter_spec.txt` for each subsegment, including prior type, calibration, posterior validation, provenance, units, default/fallback, interface consumer, and short descriptions
    - Ensured every parameter has deterministic provenance tags (artefact/file + SHA-256), explicit machine-auditable acceptance ranges, and CI-enforced validation or drift-detection logic
    - Closed all parameter gaps per subsegment; explicitly handled default/fallback policy, interface consumers, and test pathways
    - All outputs in strict copy-paste markdown, ready for LLM-driven, deviation-proof code generation
    - Ready for transition to interface contracts specification layer
