* 7:40pm
  * Moving to phase 6 patch for my data generator
    1. Extends your YAML config with `device` and `amount` parameters. 
    2. Updates your Pydantic schema to validate those sections. 
    3. Augments the merchant catalog with an `mcc_code`. 
    4. Patches your core generator to:
       * Sample amounts from a log-normal (or normal/uniform) distribution per config 
       * Sample a `device_type` via weighted `random.choices`
       * Map each merchant’s MCC → `currency` and `timezone`
