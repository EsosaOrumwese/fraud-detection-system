* 6:12am
  * Finished extracting the artefact registry from narratives and assumptions, and also rewrote `governing_artefacts_XX.txt` for all  subsegments.
  * In order to get the interface contract, I need to extract other docs firstly
    * [ ] **Schemas**: ingress & egress captured; partitioning & ordering declared; constraints noted.
    * [X] **Required artifacts**: all `artifact_id` + `digest_key` populated from your registry.
    * [ ] **Invariants & Exceptions**: named and described; exception message fields specified.
    * [ ] **RNG contract**: seed fields + sub‑stream policy pinned.
    * [ ] **Logging**: path, rotation, and **field list** fixed.
    * [ ] **Performance**: batch size set; other numbers `TBD` or filled.
    * [ ] **Privacy/Licenses/Ownership**: set.
    * [ ] **Interface contract** compiled; CI validates that no `TBD/null` remain for production.

* 9:42pm
  * It appears my initial work on extracting `build_repro/`, `edge_case/`, `interface_contract/`, `parameter_prior_posterior/` and `version_matrix` was just a waste of time.
    * Because I didn't allow the model to define its own plan for handling artefact registry, parameters and finally an interface contract, it couldn't do its best work.
    * Instead, I straight up asked for a prompt to extract the needed values without understand fully well what I wanted as the end result for these documents.
      * This resulted in flimsy catalogues and specs where things like `schemas` and other important value concerning each artefact was just hallucinated
    * This also explained why I spent the whole of `2025-07-27` trying to figure out how to get all the specific, in machine-readable format, of all the information of the merchant-location realism layer;
      * such that I could freeze it and give the next layer, arrival time, exactly all the information about the interconnectivity of layer one and the expected parameters it should received
      * this machine-readable format was also neccesary because in closing up layer 1, it means that every single detail about function, artefact or process has been specifically defined and not just hidden in the prose.
    * This is where the new docs above come in, as they help drive specificity in layer 1
