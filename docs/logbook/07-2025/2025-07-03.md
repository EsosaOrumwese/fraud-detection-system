* 11:24pm
  * Began fixing up the tests that broke due to the phase 6 update of the synthetic data generator

* 1:32pm
  * Noticed that my data generator isn't generating any data due to how complex it is

* 7:23pm
  * Reduced majority of the complexity in my data generator and confirms it works in a matter of seconds -> ~20s for 1M rows and 500secs for 10M

* 10:44pm
  * Fix the `CategoricalRemappingWarning` caused by casting the string columns to Categorical columns at chunk by only allowing one single global cast (after concatenation)
