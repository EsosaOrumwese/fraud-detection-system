* 7:37pm
  * Aim: Lock down layer 1.
    * What does this mean? Ensuring that merchant-location realism is specifically (emphasis on specificity) defined such I get to see the workings and interconnection of every element/artefact in that layer
    * Started by identifying all the artefacts and their dependencies based on the design. Next will be to define the schemas for our internal dataset and collect/confirm the sources of our external dataset.
    * Think of this layer as the 'engine' of the synthetic data generator which we'll take as the whole 'car'.
    * Before now, we had focused on the engine and described how we would get from cast metal components to a running engine sending power to where needs be.
    * However, the exact blueprint for coupling these parts to make the whole wasn't and isn't there. Infact, the exact parts/sizes/types weren't even specified.
    * It is in finding the artefacts that we get the building blocks for the engine, connecting it up or seeing how it connects is another story.
    * For now, we have the part list and what depends on the other. Now in verifying the schema, we verify the sizes/measurements/standards/material of these parts that we have named per our design.
    * Once that is done, we need to look at the small components that make up the whole, how does parts come together to make up the components, how those in turn make up the whole and how they all interact with each other.

* 10:00pm
  * Finalized contract development plan to lock down layer 1 will soon create a doc in prompt to reflect this
