* 1:40am
  * Started working on the version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer

* 8:11am
  * Finished working on the temporal version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer. 
  * Summary:
    * Added “Temporal Version Matrix Finder” prompt and logic for sub-segments 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B of the Merchant-Location Realism layer.
    * Performed exhaustive gap analysis (TVM-F) on all artefacts:
      * Flagged missing or ambiguous fields: version_tag, valid_window, update_cadence,sha256_digest, and compatibility_matrix.
      * Produced 35 TV blocks for 1B, 14 for 2A, 13 for 2B, 15 for 3A, 18 for 3B, 11 for 4A, and 20 for 4B.
    * Developed “Temporal Version Matrix Spec-Writer” (TVM-S) to close all gaps:
      * Generated concrete TOML TV-FIX entries with draft version_tags, valid windows, update cadences, placeholder sha256 values, and compatibility lists. 
      * Ensured deterministic, sorted output in VERSION_MATRIX.toml for each sub-segment.
    * Established rationale footer summarizing gaps closed per artefact ID.
    * Validated adherence to format rules: no bullets in output blocks, code-block ready, split tokens if necessary, and clear context chains.
  * Begun work on the edge-case pathways sub-layer.

* 9:03am
  * Updated my Edge-case catalogue finder and specifications writer prompt to be more specific.

* 12:24pm
  * Add full edge-case coverage for all merchant-location realism subsegments 1A through 4B
  * Summary
    * _Added_
      - 1A (merchants→physical sites): CF entries EC-1–EC-7; SW fixes EC-1–EC-7 closing detection, recovery, idempotence, monitoring, format, interface, and CI test gaps.
      - 1B (placing outlets on the planet): CF entries EC-1–EC-13; SW fixes EC-1–EC-13.
      - 2A (civil time zone derivation): CF entries EC-1–EC-14; SW fixes EC-1–EC-14.
      - 2B (routing through sites): CF entries EC-1–EC-13; SW fixes EC-1–EC-13.
      - 3A (cross-zone merchants): CF entries EC-1–EC-14; SW fixes EC-1–EC-14.
      - 3B (purely virtual merchants): CF entries EC-1–EC-16; SW fixes EC-1–EC-16.
      - 4A (reproducibility & configurability): CF entries EC-1–EC-11; SW fixes EC-1–EC-11.
      - 4B (validation without bullets): CF entries EC-1–EC-19; SW fixes EC-1–EC-19.
    * _Changed_
      - Standardized CF block headers to include `Stage` and `Severity` for all subsegments.
      - Harmonized `Expected_format`, `Interface_affected`, and `Test_pathway` fields across all EC-FIX blocks.
      - Refined severity classification: missing artifacts and digest mismatches now HIGH; performance gaps MED; clarity gaps LOW.
    * _Fixed_
      - Closed detection gaps for missing configuration files (YAML, CSV, Parquet, GeoTIFF, SQLite, Shapefile, JSON Schema).
      - Added idempotence guarantees and monitoring metrics for every recovery action.
      - Ensured CI/fuzz/unit test injections cover all failure scenarios.
    * _Removed_
      - Deprecated placeholder entries and ambiguous “partial handling” markers from earlier drafts.
      - Eliminated inconsistent anchor quoting and inline citation tags.
    * _Breaking_
      - Introduces strict CF/SW token-management markers (`<<EC-CONTINUE>>`, `<<ES-CONTINUE>>`), may require parser updates.
      - EC-FIX blocks now enforce zero-retry aborts by default except where ret
