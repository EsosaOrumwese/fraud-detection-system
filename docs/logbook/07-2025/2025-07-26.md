* 1:40am
  * Started working on the version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer

* 8:11am
  * Finished working on the temporal version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer. 
  * Summary:
    * Added “Temporal Version Matrix Finder” prompt and logic for sub-segments 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B of the Merchant-Location Realism layer.
    * Performed exhaustive gap analysis (TVM-F) on all artefacts:
      * Flagged missing or ambiguous fields: version_tag, valid_window, update_cadence,sha256_digest, and compatibility_matrix.
      * Produced 35 TV blocks for 1B, 14 for 2A, 13 for 2B, 15 for 3A, 18 for 3B, 11 for 4A, and 20 for 4B.
      * Developed “Temporal Version Matrix Spec-Writer” (TVM-S) to close all gaps:
        * Generated concrete TOML TV-FIX entries with draft version_tags, valid windows, update cadences, placeholder sha256 values, and compatibility lists. 
        * Ensured deterministic, sorted output in VERSION_MATRIX.toml for each sub-segment.
      * Established rationale footer summarizing gaps closed per artefact ID.
      * Validated adherence to format rules: no bullets in output blocks, code-block ready, split tokens if necessary, and clear context chains.
