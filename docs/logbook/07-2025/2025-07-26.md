* 1:40am
  * Started working on the version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer

* 8:11am
  * Finished working on the temporal version matrix sub-layer of the specifications layer. 
  * Summary:
    * Added “Temporal Version Matrix Finder” prompt and logic for sub-segments 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B of the Merchant-Location Realism layer.
    * Performed exhaustive gap analysis (TVM-F) on all artefacts:
      * Flagged missing or ambiguous fields: version_tag, valid_window, update_cadence,sha256_digest, and compatibility_matrix.
      * Produced 35 TV blocks for 1B, 14 for 2A, 13 for 2B, 15 for 3A, 18 for 3B, 11 for 4A, and 20 for 4B.
    * Developed “Temporal Version Matrix Spec-Writer” (TVM-S) to close all gaps:
      * Generated concrete TOML TV-FIX entries with draft version_tags, valid windows, update cadences, placeholder sha256 values, and compatibility lists. 
      * Ensured deterministic, sorted output in VERSION_MATRIX.toml for each sub-segment.
    * Established rationale footer summarizing gaps closed per artefact ID.
    * Validated adherence to format rules: no bullets in output blocks, code-block ready, split tokens if necessary, and clear context chains.
  * Begun work on the edge-case pathways sub-layer.

* 9:03am
  * Updated my Edge-case catalogue finder and specifications writer prompt to be more specific.

* 12:24pm
  * Add full edge-case coverage for all merchant-location realism subsegments 1A through 4B
  * Summary
    * _Added_
      - 1A (merchants→physical sites): CF entries EC-1–EC-7; SW fixes EC-1–EC-7 closing detection, recovery, idempotence, monitoring, format, interface, and CI test gaps.
      - 1B (placing outlets on the planet): CF entries EC-1–EC-13; SW fixes EC-1–EC-13.
      - 2A (civil time zone derivation): CF entries EC-1–EC-14; SW fixes EC-1–EC-14.
      - 2B (routing through sites): CF entries EC-1–EC-13; SW fixes EC-1–EC-13.
      - 3A (cross-zone merchants): CF entries EC-1–EC-14; SW fixes EC-1–EC-14.
      - 3B (purely virtual merchants): CF entries EC-1–EC-16; SW fixes EC-1–EC-16.
      - 4A (reproducibility & configurability): CF entries EC-1–EC-11; SW fixes EC-1–EC-11.
      - 4B (validation without bullets): CF entries EC-1–EC-19; SW fixes EC-1–EC-19.
    * _Changed_
      - Standardized CF block headers to include `Stage` and `Severity` for all subsegments.
      - Harmonized `Expected_format`, `Interface_affected`, and `Test_pathway` fields across all EC-FIX blocks.
      - Refined severity classification: missing artifacts and digest mismatches now HIGH; performance gaps MED; clarity gaps LOW.
    * _Fixed_
      - Closed detection gaps for missing configuration files (YAML, CSV, Parquet, GeoTIFF, SQLite, Shapefile, JSON Schema).
      - Added idempotence guarantees and monitoring metrics for every recovery action.
      - Ensured CI/fuzz/unit test injections cover all failure scenarios.
    * _Removed_
      - Deprecated placeholder entries and ambiguous “partial handling” markers from earlier drafts.
      - Eliminated inconsistent anchor quoting and inline citation tags.
    * _Breaking_
      - Introduces strict CF/SW token-management markers (`<<EC-CONTINUE>>`, `<<ES-CONTINUE>>`), may require parser updates.
      - EC-FIX blocks now enforce zero-retry aborts by default where necessary.

* 4:48pm
  * Updated my Build Reproducibility catalogue finder and specifications writer prompt to be more specific.
  * Begun working on the build reproducibility specifications sublayer.

* 11:18pm
  * lock down build‐repro artifacts for subsegments 1A–4B
  * Summary of work done
    - Run Build-Repro Catalogue Finder & Spec-Writer across all eight subsegments (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B)
    - Surface and pin a total of: 
      - 13 artefacts in 1A, 26 artefacts in 1B, 19 artefacts in 2A, 19 artefacts in 2B, 13 artefacts in 3A, 13 artefacts in 3B, 20 artefacts in 4A, and 11 artefacts in 4B  
    - For each artefact, generate BR-FIX blocks with:
      - sha256 digest placeholders  
      - explicit version_pin placeholders  
      - lockfile, build_script, CI_pipeline, seed, manifest and repro_instructions entries  
      - standardized docker_run & nix_shell commands  
      - unified output_manifest algorithm (sha256_xor)  
      - env_locales (C.UTF-8/UTC), SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, compiler_version, OS_release placeholders  
    - Close 100% of gap_flags for digest_missing, version_missing, manifest_missing  
    - Mark optional fields (lockfile, compiler, OS, tarball) as `n/a` where inapplicable  
    - Ensure no ambiguous or empty fields remain; placeholders clearly indicate “to be populated”
