* 7:21pm
  * Exhaustive parameter catalogue & specs for merchant‑location realism engine
  * Summary:
    - Ran Parameter Catalogue‑Finder (PCF) and Spec‑Writer (PS) for sub‑segments 1A–4B
    - Extracted every stochastic prior, constant, threshold, artefact reference and CI gate
    - Filled all gaps: prior types, hyperparameters, calibration recipes, posterior validations, provenance tags, units, default policies, interface consumers, descriptions, test pathways
    - Added missing μ_γ and Uniform(0,1) deviates in 2B
    - Produced  PP blocks (catalogue) and PP‑FIX blocks (spec) for ~100 parameters across 8 sub‑segments
    - Confirmed exhaustive coverage with zero unresolved gaps before moving to interface contracts
