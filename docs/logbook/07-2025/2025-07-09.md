### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Issues Resolved: [SD-01](https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/issues/24) `in-progress`
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 10:59am
  * SD-01 is nearly complete, time to update the doc strings and also add a data dictionary.
  * (NOTE): Also, now that I upload the catalogue entities to my `fraud-artifacts-bucket`, I also need to integrate this as well as the updated realism flag into my Airflow DAG.
  * (NOTE): I generate `n_rows` UUID4 which bloats my catalogue and makes it of no use.

* 11:45am
  * Roughly updated project README. 
  * Turns out that I misinterpreted what the number of catalog entities produced. It generally produced a bit below what was stated in the config for customers and unique cards. However, produced the exact number for merchants.
  * Also, having the # of UUID4 generated being equal to n_rows is expected.
  * (Note) Now that that issue is solved, the next thing that should be on our mind is that fact that `"previous_txn_id": [None]*chunk_rows,` in `core.py`

* 10:04pm
  * Drafting pull request to contain changes made to revamp data gen and also SD-01 implementation
  * Description of former data generator in `docs/references/[DATA-GEN]_high_level_arch_former_data_gen.md`
