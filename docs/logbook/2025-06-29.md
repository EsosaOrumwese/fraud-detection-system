### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:31am
  * Added test suite for the temporal feature of the data generator.
    * `tests/unit/test_temporal.py`: Covers `sample_timestamps` in isolation
    * `tests/unit/test_core_temporal.py`: Validates that generate_dataframe correctly uses the timestamps
  * Random question: Why doesn't the progress bar in GE validate show well in the Docker logs or Airflow logs?
    * Instead, it prints it out stage by stage instead of showing one consistent bar that updates.
  * Tests added and now working fine.
