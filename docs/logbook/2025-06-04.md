* 8:32am
  * `pytest` when running tests in `./tests/units/` couldn't find my defined package in `./src/` 
    * To fix I had to follow [these recommendations from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10253826/path-issue-with-pytest-importerror-no-module-named) which involved me editing the `pythonpaths` in `pytest.ini` to include '`.`' and '`src`'.
  * Commited the changes but now would focus on meeting the last checkbox which is uploading my data to the s3 raw_bucket.

* 10:26am
  * Implemented SSM‐backed `get_param("/fraud/raw_bucket_name")` helper to fetch and cache the raw S3 bucket name in `.env` at runtime.
  * Refactored Makefile to call `scripts/pull_raw_bucket.py` for SSM lookup, then run `gen-data-raw` with `RAW_BUCKET` set from SSM.
  * Resolved 'module not found' errors when running scripts by just referencing `src/fraud_detection/...`

* 11:41am
  * Realized that to resolve the `module not found error`, all I had to do was change the name in my `pyproject.toml` to match the package name in `src` i.e. from `fraud-detection-system` (repo name) to `fraud_detection`.
  * Confirmed that all works well now after `poetry install`. I don't have to add arg `--no-root`
  * Opened a PR and successfully merged with all-green apart from `daily costs workflow` which I disabled because I nuked the OIDC resource which it uses. I could enable it before every PR -> merge and nuke after running.
