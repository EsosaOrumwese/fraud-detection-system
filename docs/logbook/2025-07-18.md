* 8:09am
  * Add companion document which lays out the assumptions for each of the subsegments in my detailed narrative

* 6:34pm
  * Focus on prompt engineering now for building a spec that defines a feature and will be translated to code. As a result, I'll have to create a `docs/prompt_engr/` with `prompts/`, `specs/`, and `assumptions` folders.

* 10:06pm
  * Generated a well crafted prompt (`docs/prompt_engr/prompts/hole_finder_for_narrative_and_assumptions.md`) to help find and result ambiguity in my narrative and assumptions.
