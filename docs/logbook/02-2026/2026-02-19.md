* 1:03AM
  - Opened `P9.C` lane by user direction (`plan it out and proceed`).
  - Per live logging correction, recorded pre-change execution plan before edits/execution in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
      (`P9.C pre-change execution plan` entry).
  - Entry-gate checks confirmed:
    - `M7.E` source snapshot present and pass (`overall_pass=true`),
    - `M7.F` source snapshot present and pass (`overall_pass=true`),
    - `P9.C` still open in `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`.
  - Planned execution path:
    - expand `P9.C` section to execution-grade detail,
    - generate deterministic `m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`,
    - publish local + durable evidence,
    - mark `P9.C` complete if blocker rollup remains empty.

* 1:08AM
  - Completed `P9.C` execution.
  - Expanded `P9.C` plan depth in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`
      (required inputs, prep checks, deterministic rollup algorithm, execution result).
  - Generated deterministic plane rollup snapshot:
    - local:
      - `runs/dev_substrate/m7/20260218T141420Z/m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`
    - durable:
      - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`
  - Rollup verdict:
    - source snapshots (`M7.E`, `M7.F`) both `overall_pass=true`,
    - blocker rollup empty,
    - `p9_overall_pass=true`.
  - Count rollup recorded:
    - decisions `200`, intents `200`, outcomes `200`, audit records `600`.
  - Synced closure status in:
    - `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md` (`P9.C` complete),
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md` (P9.C closure note),
    - `platform.build_plan.md` (active-phase closure note),
    - `platform.impl_actual.md` (post-change entry).

* 1:15AM
  - Opened `M7.P10` planning lane for `P10.A` by user direction.
  - Recorded pre-change planning lock in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
      (`P10.A planning pre-change lock` entry).
  - Confirmed planning posture before edits:
    - `P9` prerequisite is closed (`P9.C` pass),
    - `M7G-B1` remains open due placeholder subject-key handles in registry.
  - Expansion target for this step:
    - deepen `P10.A` to execution-grade coverage (inputs/checks/algorithm/budgets/blockers),
    - keep this step planning-only (no runtime execution yet).

* 1:12AM
  - Expanded Segment `3A` `POPT.1` into execution-grade sub-phases in
    `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_3A.build_plan.md`.
  - Added explicit lane order and scope:
    - primary `S6`, secondary `S7`, conditional closure `S5`.
  - Added runtime + veto gates for closure:
    - `S6`: `<=14.0s` or >=15% reduction,
    - `S7`: `<=12.0s` or >=10% reduction,
    - `S5` (if executed): `<=12.0s` or >=8% reduction,
    - plus strict PASS/no-schema/no-index-drift constraints.
  - Added rerun law and storage posture for this phase:
    - `S6` change => rerun `S6->S7`,
    - `S7` change => rerun `S7`,
    - `S5` change => rerun `S5->S6->S7`,
    - prune superseded run-id folders before expensive passes.
  - Added planned closure artifacts:
    - `segment3a_popt1_closure_<run_id>.json`
    - `segment3a_popt1_closure_<run_id>.md`
  - Decision trail appended in `segment_3A.impl_actual.md`.

* 1:21AM
  - Completed P10.A planning-depth expansion in
    `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md`.
  - Added execution-grade closure detail for `M7.G` / `P10.A`:
    - entry conditions pinned to `P9.C` pass,
    - required input lanes (identity/DB/services/runtime truth anchors),
    - deterministic fail-closed verification algorithm,
    - required snapshot fields,
    - runtime budget gate (`<=15 minutes`) and DoD coverage.
  - Added blocker coverage for hidden failure classes:
    - `M7G-B4` subject-key drift vs runtime truth,
    - `M7G-B5` CM/LS readiness failure.
  - Runtime execution was not performed in this step; this was planning-only by request.

* 1:16AM
  - Locked pre-change execution plan for Segment `3A` `POPT.1` in
    `segment_3A.impl_actual.md` before code edits.
  - Pinned execution order:
    - `POPT.1.1` scorer lock,
    - `POPT.1.2` `S6` optimization,
    - `POPT.1.3` `S7` optimization,
    - `POPT.1.4` `S5` conditional,
    - `POPT.1.5/1.6` witness + closure.
  - Pinned optimization strategy:
    - remove duplicate line-count scans,
    - remove redundant downstream row-schema re-validation where upstream
      validation is already authoritative,
    - keep fail-closed required-column and structural-veto behavior.
  - Next in-flight step: implement `POPT.1.1` closure scorer script.

* 1:24AM
  - Opened `M7G-B1` closure lane by user direction (`let's resolve those`).
  - Verified runtime truth before pinning:
    - CM subject fields: `platform_run_id,event_class,event_id`.
    - LS subject fields: `platform_run_id,event_id`.
  - Planned registry update in
    `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
    to replace `<PIN_AT_P10_PHASE_ENTRY>` placeholders with runtime-aligned concrete values.

* 1:23AM
  - Implemented Segment `3A` `POPT.1` code pass (`S6/S7`) + closure scorer.
  - Added scorer:
    - `tools/score_segment3a_popt1_closure.py`.
  - `S6` optimization applied:
    - removed duplicate RNG log pre-count scans,
    - switched progress tracking to single-pass unknown-total mode,
    - replaced redundant parquet row-schema re-validation with fail-closed
      required-column guards for upstream datasets.
  - `S7` optimization applied:
    - removed duplicate JSONL pre-count scans,
    - added trusted heavy parquet fast-path (`S1/S2/S3/S4/S5`) with
      required-column guards and retained file-byte digest hashing,
    - retained strict schema validation for non-trusted parquet members.
  - Compile verification: passed for patched modules and scorer.
  - Next in-flight: execute fresh candidate run and score `POPT.1` closure gates.

* 1:26AM
  - Applied subject-key registry pin to close `M7G-B1`:
    - `CASE_SUBJECT_KEY_FIELDS = "platform_run_id,event_class,event_id"`
    - `LABEL_SUBJECT_KEY_FIELDS = "platform_run_id,event_id"`
  - Updated file:
    `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`.
  - Verified placeholders for these two handles are removed and values align with CM/LS runtime constants.
  - `P10.A` can now execute (remaining runtime checks: DB readiness + service posture + snapshot publish).

* 1:31AM
  - Started live execution of `M7.G` / `P10.A` by user direction.
  - Pinned execution contract for this lane:
    - keep current run scope (`platform_20260213T214223Z`, `m7_20260218T141420Z`),
    - run fail-closed checks in sequence (identity -> DB readiness -> service readiness -> snapshot publish),
    - append decision/process notes continuously during execution.
  - Chosen posture: no new helper files; use direct AWS/runtime probes and deterministic snapshot assembly.

* 1:32AM
  - Opened Segment `3A` `POPT.1` closure-unblock pass after scoring candidate
    `3bad5e09e5ae46a3beb949dd718233fa`.
  - Confirmed closure status:
    - `S6/S7` runtime gates are clear,
    - `S5` required runtime gate remains open,
    - `S7 _passed.flag` veto miss is scorer-side (flag exists on disk).
  - Pinned edit sequence before coding:
    1) scorer flag-detection fix,
    2) `S6/S7` unknown-total progress throttle,
    3) `S5` upstream validation fast-path (fail-closed column guards),
    4) rerun + rescore + prune.

* 1:36AM
  - Live `P10.A` probes found runtime-command drift on case/label services:
    - `case-mgmt` and `label-store` tasks are scheduler-healthy but run sleep-loop stub commands (not real worker runtime).
    - DB migrations task-definition is also a stub command.
  - Mid-execution decision (fail-closed):
    - proceed to publish `M7.G` snapshot with explicit blockers for DB-readiness and service-runtime-conformance,
    - do not use local DB probing as substitute for managed-runtime proof.

* 1:40AM
  - Executed `M7.G` / `P10.A` and published snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m7/20260218T141420Z/m7_g_case_label_db_readiness_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_g_case_label_db_readiness_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed (`overall_pass=false`) with blockers:
    - `M7G-B2` (DB readiness/migration proof not materialized),
    - `M7G-B5` (CM/LS runtime command conformance failure).
  - Explicitly confirmed green subset within P10.A:
    - subject-key handle pin is now runtime-aligned and non-placeholder.
  - Decision: hold progression to `M7.H` and sync M7/M7.P10/main plan docs to this runtime truth.

* 1:36AM
  - Implemented Segment `3A` `POPT.1` closure-unblock edits:
    - scorer fix for `S7 _passed.flag` veto detection,
    - unknown-total progress-throttle in `S6/S7`,
    - `S5` upstream validation fast-path with fail-closed required-column guards.
  - Compile verification passed for patched files.
  - Staged fresh run-id `81599ab107ba4c8db7fc5850287360fe` and executed full
    `segment3a` chain (`S0->S7`) successfully.
  - Scoring outputs emitted:
    - `segment3a_popt0_baseline_81599ab107ba4c8db7fc5850287360fe.json`
    - `segment3a_popt1_closure_81599ab107ba4c8db7fc5850287360fe.{json,md}`
  - Closure verdict: `UNLOCK_P0` (all runtime gates + vetoes clear).
  - Measured deltas vs baseline `06b822558c294a0888e3f8f342e83947`:
    - `S5`: `12.499s -> 4.596s` (`+63.23%`)
    - `S6`: `17.942s -> 2.933s` (`+83.65%`)
    - `S7`: `13.145s -> 2.249s` (`+82.89%`)
  - Storage hygiene applied:
    - pruned failed sentinels (none),
    - pruned superseded run-id `3bad5e09e5ae46a3beb949dd718233fa`,
    - retained only `06b822558c294a0888e3f8f342e83947` + `81599ab107ba4c8db7fc5850287360fe`.

* 1:44AM
  - Synced `P10.A` fail-closed execution truth into planning docs:
    - `platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md`
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`
    - `platform.build_plan.md`
  - Updated blocker posture:
    - `M7G-B1` closed (historical debt),
    - active blockers now `M7G-B2` and `M7G-B5`.
  - Updated immediate next action to remediation + rerun of `M7.G` before any `M7.H` progression.
