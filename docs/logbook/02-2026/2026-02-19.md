* 1:03AM
  - Opened `P9.C` lane by user direction (`plan it out and proceed`).
  - Per live logging correction, recorded pre-change execution plan before edits/execution in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
      (`P9.C pre-change execution plan` entry).
  - Entry-gate checks confirmed:
    - `M7.E` source snapshot present and pass (`overall_pass=true`),
    - `M7.F` source snapshot present and pass (`overall_pass=true`),
    - `P9.C` still open in `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`.
  - Planned execution path:
    - expand `P9.C` section to execution-grade detail,
    - generate deterministic `m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`,
    - publish local + durable evidence,
    - mark `P9.C` complete if blocker rollup remains empty.

* 1:08AM
  - Completed `P9.C` execution.
  - Expanded `P9.C` plan depth in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`
      (required inputs, prep checks, deterministic rollup algorithm, execution result).
  - Generated deterministic plane rollup snapshot:
    - local:
      - `runs/dev_substrate/m7/20260218T141420Z/m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`
    - durable:
      - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_p9_plane_snapshot.json`
  - Rollup verdict:
    - source snapshots (`M7.E`, `M7.F`) both `overall_pass=true`,
    - blocker rollup empty,
    - `p9_overall_pass=true`.
  - Count rollup recorded:
    - decisions `200`, intents `200`, outcomes `200`, audit records `600`.
  - Synced closure status in:
    - `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md` (`P9.C` complete),
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md` (P9.C closure note),
    - `platform.build_plan.md` (active-phase closure note),
    - `platform.impl_actual.md` (post-change entry).
