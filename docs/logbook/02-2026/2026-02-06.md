* 04:13AM
  - Extended 6B Phase 2 analysis (no report edits): joined arrival_events_5B with arrival_entities_6B and 6A/5A bases to assess channel mix, cross-border (party vs merchant country), device/account linkage diversity, merchant class mix, virtual share by class, tzid vs merchant tz match, and multi-arrival session gap structure.

* 04:22AM
  - Extended 6B Phase 2 with class-level cross-border analysis, merchant-weighted vs arrival-weighted cross-border rates (deduped merchant_dim), and session gap distributions by merchant class using multi-arrival session samples.

  - Appended extended Phase 2 analysis sections to segment_6B_published_report.md (channel mix/virtual posture, geographic cross-border + tz alignment, linkage diversity, population weighting, merchant class mix, class-level cross-border with volume effects, and class-conditioned session gaps). Reworked lists to avoid nested bullets.

* 05:02AM
  - Computed cross-border rates by merchant size deciles and top-1%/top-5% merchant buckets; quantified arrival-share and cross-border amplification for large merchants.

Renumbered Phase 2 conclusion to 11.18.

* 06:06AM
  - Ran Phase 3 (S2 baseline flows/events) statistical checks: amount distribution (min/max/quantiles), distinct amount count and per-amount shares, precision check, per-merchant distinct amounts, class/virtual amount profiles, and timing/amount alignment between flows, events, and arrival_events (sample-based). Drafted interpretation notes.

  - Attempted fresh 200-event parity run; LocalStack/MinIO endpoints unreachable.
  - `make platform-parity-stack-up` failed: Docker Desktop engine not available.
  - Parity run deferred until Docker services are running.

* 09:16AM
  - Expanded report section 13.8–13.12 in segment 6B with additional interpretation detail. Computed Phase‑4 extension metrics: fraud concentration by merchant size deciles, per‑campaign class and cross‑border targeting (using merchant_class_profile + deduped merchant_zone_profile + party_base_6A), and inter‑arrival gaps within campaign; verified no repeat fraud per campaign+merchant+party.

* 09:20AM

* 02:04PM
  - Generated Segment 6B statistical plots (01–10) in docs/reports/reports/eda/segment_6B/plots covering truth saturation, bank-view flatness, confusion matrix, case gaps/durations, fraud concentration, top-k shares, amount distribution, uplift, and cross-border rates.

* 02:38PM
  - Refreshed 6B presentation plots (02,04,05,08) via docs/reports/reports/eda/segment_6B/plot_segment_6B_refresh.py: corrected amount-bin ordering, masked low-support heatmap cells, changed case gap/duration charts to exact-value bars, and rebuilt amount distribution as discrete price-point bars with readable labels.

* 02:45PM
  - Standardized Segment 6B plot deck style end-to-end using docs/reports/reports/eda/segment_6B/plot_segment_6B_uniform_all.py (uniform typography, title styling, axis labeling, annotation formatting, and figure sizing) and fixed final QA defects (confusion-matrix annotation contrast + Lorenz title clipping).

  - Logbook format decision: new entries will use the short `* HH:MMAM/PM` style.

* 02:54PM
  - Reordered Segment 6B report so final grade remains the last section: moved former Section 19 visual diagnostics above final grade and renamed it to 'Appendix A' with subheads A.1-A.10; Section 18 now closes the document.

* 03:00PM
  - Normalized this day logbook to match house style: unified timestamp format (* HH:MMAM/PM), inserted blank line separation between entries, and cleaned mixed timestamp syntax into one readable layout.

* 03:10PM

  - Ran local-parity OFP projector smoke (--once) for run $run with run-scope lock (OFP_REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260206T143456Z).
