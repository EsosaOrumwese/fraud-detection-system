* 04:01AM
  - Ran 6B Phase 2 attachment + sessionisation statistical checks (approx distinct counts, arrival concentration, linkage degrees, session duration/arrival counts) for run c25a...
  - Added Phase 2 analysis to segment_6B_published_report.md with detailed explanations and realism verdict.
  
* 04:13AM
  - Extended 6B Phase 2 analysis (no report edits): joined arrival_events_5B with arrival_entities_6B and 6A/5A bases to assess channel mix, cross-border (party vs merchant country), device/account linkage diversity, merchant class mix, virtual share by class, tzid vs merchant tz match, and multi-arrival session gap structure.
* 04:22AM
  - Extended 6B Phase 2 with class-level cross-border analysis, merchant-weighted vs arrival-weighted cross-border rates (deduped merchant_dim), and session gap distributions by merchant class using multi-arrival session samples.
* 04:30AM
  - Appended extended Phase 2 analysis sections to segment_6B_published_report.md (channel mix/virtual posture, geographic cross-border + tz alignment, linkage diversity, population weighting, merchant class mix, class-level cross-border with volume effects, and class-conditioned session gaps). Reworked lists to avoid nested bullets.
* 05:02AM
  - Computed cross-border rates by merchant size deciles and top-1%/top-5% merchant buckets; quantified arrival-share and cross-border amplification for large merchants.
  - Computed full multi-arrival session gap distributions by virtual vs non-virtual and virtual session counts (324 of 76,270 multi-arrival sessions).
  - Computed cross-border rates by party segment_id (arrival-weighted) to assess segment-level bias.
* 05:12AM
  - Added 6B Phase 2 extensions to segment_6B_published_report.md: cross-border by merchant size deciles with top-1%/top-5% impact, session gap distributions by virtual vs non-virtual, and cross-border rates by party segment. Renumbered Phase 2 conclusion to 11.15.
