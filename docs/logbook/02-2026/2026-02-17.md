* 4:36AM
  - Started `Segment 2A POPT.2` on secondary hotspot `S3` (`s3_timetable`).
  - Captured pre-implementation decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
  - Chosen optimization lane:
    - add deterministic shared cache for compiled S3 timetable index keyed by sealed `tzdb_archive_sha256`,
    - preserve all existing coverage/path-law/contract validations.

* 4:38AM
  - Implemented `S3` cache acceleration in:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s3_timetable/runner.py`
  - Added:
    - cache root/key/load/store helpers,
    - cache-hit execution branch with validation parity,
    - cache-miss atomic cache store,
    - small safe overhead trims (progress log cadence, non-pyarrow tzid extraction).
  - Compile validation:
    - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s3_timetable/runner.py` PASS.

* 4:39AM
  - Executed candidate chain on current run-id:
    - `make segment2a-s3 segment2a-s4 segment2a-s5 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A RUN_ID=b65bfe6efaca42e2ac413c059fb88b64`
  - First pass behavior:
    - `S3` cache miss (`CACHE_STORE` emitted),
    - `S4` PASS,
    - `S5` PASS.
  - Second pass behavior:
    - `S3` cache hit (`CACHE_HIT` emitted),
    - `S4` PASS,
    - `S5` PASS.

* 4:40AM
  - Regenerated 2A hotspot artifact for candidate run:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A/reports/segment2a_popt0_baseline_b65bfe6efaca42e2ac413c059fb88b64.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A/reports/segment2a_popt0_hotspot_map_b65bfe6efaca42e2ac413c059fb88b64.md`
  - Runtime evidence:
    - baseline anchor (`dd4...`) `S3 wall_ms=10141`,
    - warm cached candidate `S3 wall_ms=562` (`~94.5%` faster),
    - hotspot order shifted to `S1 > S2 > S0`; `S3` no longer a top hotspot.
  - Updated closure docs:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.build_plan.md`
  - `POPT.2` marked closed for fast-iteration posture; next open lane is `POPT.3`.

* 4:48AM
  - Started `Segment 2A POPT.3` (validation/closure acceleration lane) focused on `S5`.
  - Captured pre-implementation design decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
  - Chosen approach:
    - keep all hard checks fail-closed,
    - remove redundant temp-bundle writes on unchanged reruns via deterministic existing-bundle reuse.

* 5:09AM
  - Implemented `S5` optimization in:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s5_validation_bundle/runner.py`
  - Key mechanics:
    - in-memory evidence/index/check payload synthesis,
    - deterministic existing-bundle matcher (`index/checks/evidence/flag` byte parity),
    - `REUSE` fast path and fail-closed fallback to full publish path.
  - Additional safe trims:
    - removed unused `schemas.1B.yaml` load from S5 path,
    - linearized duplicate-index detection.
  - Compile validation:
    - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s5_validation_bundle/runner.py` PASS.

* 5:09AM
  - Executed repeated warm witnesses on candidate run:

    - observed `REUSE` path and `decision=PASS` on both runs.
  - Executed authority witness:
    - `make segment2a-s5 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A RUN_ID=dd4ba47ab7b942a4930cbeee85eda331`,
    - observed `REUSE` path and `decision=PASS`.

    - candidate `b65...` pre-change warm: `308-318ms`,
    - candidate `b65...` post-change warm: `249-251ms`,
    - authority `dd4...`: `309ms -> 248ms`.
  - Integrated witness remained green:
    - `make segment2a-s3 segment2a-s4 segment2a-s5 ... RUN_ID=b65...` PASS.
  - Refreshed hotspot artifact:

* 5:42AM
  - Started `Segment 2A Remediation P2` full-lane execution.
  - Re-checked required-seed inventory under active run root:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A` currently has seed `42` only.
  - Decision:
    - execute P2 as two integrated tracks:
      1) implement cohort-aware scorer/gates + certification reducer,
      2) materialize missing required seeds `{7,101,202}` under frozen upstream logic, then certify.
  - Expanded P2 planning into explicit sub-phases in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.build_plan.md`

* 6:20AM
  - Began required-seed materialization for P2.
  - Corrected seed control method:
    - use `SEG1A_S0_SEED=<seed>` at `segment1a-s0` (not plain `SEED`).
  - Seed `7` lane:
    - S0 created run-id `07891eca4e6ea549a4d836db35e203aa` with `seed=7`,
    - executed `segment1a-s1..s9`, `segment1b`, `segment2a` pinned to this run-id,
    - 2A `S0..S5` all PASS.

* 6:53AM
  - Seed `101` lane:
    - S0 created run-id `513f4f2904d1ac97f2396c059a9573da` with `seed=101`,
    - downstream chain reached 2A `S1`,

  - Seed `202` lane:
    - S0 created run-id `5a8836781dd7524da561ad5aa27f64d6` with `seed=202`,
    - downstream chain reached 2A `S1`,
    - fail-closed at `2A-S1-090` (`fallback_rate_cap_exceeded`).

* 7:57AM
  - Updated scorer to treat incomplete seed lanes as explicit hard failures (not silent missing):
    - `tools/score_segment2a_p2_certification.py`
  - Executed final P2 certification run:
    - `python tools/score_segment2a_p2_certification.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A --output-dir runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A/reports`
  - Final artifacts:

  - Executed `P3.1` watchlist extraction for Segment 2A.
  - Emitted watchlist artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A/reports/segment2a_p3_watchlist_baseline.csv`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A/reports/segment2a_p3_watchlist_baseline.json`
  - Confirmed hard-fail governance hotspots:
    - seed `101`: `CN` fallback-country cap breach (`2A-S1-091`)
    - seed `202`: `GE` fallback-country cap breach and global fallback cap pressure (`2A-S1-090/091`)
  - Chosen `P3.2` bounded intervention (no cap relaxation):
    - add country overrides for `CN`, `GE`, `PS` in `tz_overrides` to convert repeated fallback resolution into explicit policy resolution with provenance.
  - Appended detailed decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`

* 5:34PM
  - Executed full `Segment 2A P3` closure lane.
  - Applied bounded governance policy corrections in:
    - `config/layer1/2A/timezone/tz_overrides.yaml`
    - added country overrides: `CN`, `GE`, `PS`.
  - Initial rerun in `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A` hit `S0` publish collision (`F4:2A-S0-062`) because retained run-ids already contained published 2A artifacts.
  - Switched to clean candidate root (non-destructive):
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3`
    - staged required upstream 1B artifacts for run-ids: `b65bfe6efaca42e2ac413c059fb88b64`, `07891eca4e6ea549a4d836db35e203aa`, `513f4f2904d1ac97f2396c059a9573da`, `5a8836781dd7524da561ad5aa27f64d6`.
  - Ran `make segment2a` for all required seeds in clean lane:
    - seeds `42, 7, 101, 202` all completed `S0->S5` PASS.
  - Certification artifacts generated:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p2_seed_metrics_42-b65bfe6e_7-07891eca_101-513f4f29_202-5a883678.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p2_country_diagnostics_42-b65bfe6e_7-07891eca_101-513f4f29_202-5a883678.csv`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p2_certification_42-b65bfe6e_7-07891eca_101-513f4f29_202-5a883678.json`
  - P3 movement artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p3_delta_summary.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p3_watchlist_candidate.csv`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2A_p3/reports/segment2a_p3_watchlist_candidate.json`
  - Outcome:
    - governance hard-fail blockers for seeds `101/202` closed,
    - aggregate verdict remains `FAIL_REALISM` due persistent concentration/entropy/representativeness misses.
  - Closure decision for P3:
    - `FREEZE_PROPOSAL` (reopen recommendation on upstream 1B representativeness lane).
