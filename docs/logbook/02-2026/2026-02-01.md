* 04:35am
  - Planned WSP dual-stream concurrency + per-output caps for READY runs; recorded in world_streamer_producer.impl_actual.

* 05:00am
  - Implemented WSP dual-stream concurrency + per-output caps; updated runbook/build plan and ran a 200-per-stream parity pass (SR → WSP → IG → EB) with no quarantines.

* 05:05am
  - Ran fresh parity flow (new platform run id), SR READY published, WSP streamed 200 per output concurrently (total 400), IG admitted with no quarantines, EB publish lines present in event_bus.log.

* 06:41AM
  - Tightened parity runbook for dual-stream completeness (explicit SR equivalence key, dual stream view check, WSP per-output cap + concurrency, corrected section numbering).

* 06:59AM
  - Updated platform build plan + platform.impl_actual flow to reflect dual-stream concurrency and updated v0 green meaning.

* 08:29AM
  - Planned sequential stream-view builds for behavioural_context + truth_products (8 outputs) with per‑output CLI override; added notes to oracle_store.impl_actual to capture decision trail and safety constraints.

* 11:46AM
  - Implemented explicit sort-key overrides for non-`ts_utc` outputs (session_start_utc / flow_id / event_seq), disabled chunking for non-time keys, and completed sequential stream-view builds for all 8 context/truth outputs; documented in oracle_store.impl_actual.
  - Added runbook note clarifying non-`ts_utc` sort keys for context/truth outputs.

* 11:49AM
  - Verified MinIO stream-view prefixes for all 8 context/truth outputs; parquet part counts present (90 parts for the time-keys, single-part for flow_id-only outputs).

* 11:56AM
  - Added `arrival_events_5B` to context/truth stream‑view list and updated runbook; logged in oracle_store.impl_actual.

* 04:07PM
  - Added `arrival_events_5B` to the context/truth stream-view list. First run OOMed during stats at 8GB; reran with threads=2, memory_limit=16GB, chunk_days=1 and completed stream view + receipt in MinIO.

* 12:07PM
  - Defaulted traffic stream to fraud only (baseline optional) and added WSP env overrides for traffic output selection; updated platform + WSP impl_actual and runbook.

* 12:16PM
  - Added helper target `platform-oracle-stream-sort-traffic-both` with dual traffic output list; updated runbook and oracle_store.impl_actual.

* 05:05PM
  - Ran parity 200-event smoke from SR → WSP → IG → EB with fraud-only traffic stream; IG admitted with quarantine=0 and EB publish lines present (platform run platform_20260201T165645Z).

* 05:02PM
  - Created `context_preloader.design-authority.md` with title and Purpose + Scope (in-scope/out-of-scope) for the Context Preloader.

* 05:08PM
  - Expanded Context Preloader design-authority Section 1 (Purpose + Scope) with detailed inputs, outputs, runtime posture, and explicit non-goals.

* 05:11PM
  - Added Section 2 (Authority and boundaries) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, detailing owned responsibilities vs explicit non-ownership.

* 05:16PM
  - Added Section 3 (Inputs) to context_preloader.design-authority.md with allowed surfaces, exclusions, identity binding, gate requirements, schema anchoring, and required pins/keys.

* 05:20PM
  - Added Section 4 (Outputs) to context_preloader.design-authority.md with join tables, optional snapshots, receipt contents, storage, and idempotent rerun behavior.

* 05:20PM
  - Added Section 5 (Join semantics) to context_preloader.design-authority.md with join order, keys, time-safety, missing-context behavior, and ownership.

* 05:21PM
  - Added Section 6 (Lifecycle and triggers) to context_preloader.design-authority.md covering triggers, ordering, retries, failure handling, and completion signal.

* 05:21PM
  - Added Section 7 (Control & Ingress interactions) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, clarifying SR/WSP/IG/EB boundaries.

* 05:22PM
  - Added Section 8 (RTDL interactions) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, covering consumption rules, provenance, failure posture, and read isolation.

* 05:22PM
  - Added Section 9 (Label & Case interactions) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, clarifying truth products are out of scope and optional read-only reuse.

* 05:22PM
  - Added Section 10 (Invariants) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, pinning no-PASS-no-read, no future leakage, idempotency, and key integrity.

* 05:23PM
  - Added Section 11 (Storage layout and indexing) to context_preloader.design-authority.md, pinning table names, primary keys, and optional snapshot layout.

* 05:23PM
  - Added Section 12 (Observability and audit) to context_preloader.design-authority.md with required logs, metrics, and receipt-based audit trail.

* 05:25PM
  - Updated Section 5 join map to reflect fraud-only runtime traffic, keeping baseline as offline/optional.

* 05:26PM
  - Added ASCII platform placement diagram to context_preloader.design-authority.md.

* 05:27PM
  - Moved and fenced the ASCII placement diagram into Section 1 as a code block and expanded it to show control/ingress, RTDL, and label/case planes.
