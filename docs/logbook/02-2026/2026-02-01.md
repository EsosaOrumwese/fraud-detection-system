* 04:35am
  - Planned WSP dual-stream concurrency + per-output caps for READY runs; recorded in world_streamer_producer.impl_actual.

* 05:00am
  - Implemented WSP dual-stream concurrency + per-output caps; updated runbook/build plan and ran a 200-per-stream parity pass (SR → WSP → IG → EB) with no quarantines.

* 05:05am
  - Ran fresh parity flow (new platform run id), SR READY published, WSP streamed 200 per output concurrently (total 400), IG admitted with no quarantines, EB publish lines present in event_bus.log.

* 06:41AM
  - Tightened parity runbook for dual-stream completeness (explicit SR equivalence key, dual stream view check, WSP per-output cap + concurrency, corrected section numbering).

* 06:59AM
  - Updated platform build plan + platform.impl_actual flow to reflect dual-stream concurrency and updated v0 green meaning.

* 08:29AM
  - Planned sequential stream-view builds for behavioural_context + truth_products (8 outputs) with per‑output CLI override; added notes to oracle_store.impl_actual to capture decision trail and safety constraints.

* 11:46AM
  - Implemented explicit sort-key overrides for non-`ts_utc` outputs (session_start_utc / flow_id / event_seq), disabled chunking for non-time keys, and completed sequential stream-view builds for all 8 context/truth outputs; documented in oracle_store.impl_actual.
  - Added runbook note clarifying non-`ts_utc` sort keys for context/truth outputs.

* 11:49AM
  - Verified MinIO stream-view prefixes for all 8 context/truth outputs; parquet part counts present (90 parts for the time-keys, single-part for flow_id-only outputs).
