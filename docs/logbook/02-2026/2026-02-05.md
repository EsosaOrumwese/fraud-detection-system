* 02:17AM
  - Added a detailed Planned Case + Labels flow section to flow-narrative-platform-design.md, aligned with design authority and pinned upstream decisions.

* 02:34AM
  - Added detailed P0 answers to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (CaseSubjectKey, CaseTrigger shape, idempotency keys, evidence refs, ActionIntent contract, LabelSubjectKey, effective/observed time rules, writer boundary, commit/ack).

* 02:35AM
  - Added detailed P1 answers to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (SLA posture, reconciliation counters/report, security/actor attribution).

* 02:35AM
  - Added detailed answers for Additional #1-4 in case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (external truth ingestion, workflow semantics, privacy/evidence access, CM-Label Store handshake).

* 02:36AM
  - Added detailed answers for Additional #5-8 in case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (label resolution, replay posture, retention, observability counters/report).

* 02:43AM
  - Applied P0 tightenings to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (CaseSubjectKey-only case_id, LabelSubjectKey=(platform_run_id,event_id), stable label_assertion_id, LS writer idempotency+payload_hash, source_type+actor_id precedence).

* 02:46AM
  - Applied minimal contradiction fixes in case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (case create dedupe key, label_assertion_id idempotency, external truth ingestion dedupe).

* 02:48AM
  - Added P0 micro-pin for label resolved view scoping (LabelSubjectKey, label_type).

* 02:51AM
  - Tightened duplicate lines in case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (case create dedupe and label_assertion_id).

* 02:59AM
  - Added micro-pins to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (explicit case_trigger_id and Label Store dedupe tuple + anomaly rule).

* 03:02AM
  - Added micro-pins to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (trigger_type enum, label_type vocabulary/value shapes, payload_hash canonicalization).

* 09:35AM
  - Reviewed platform-wide blueprint + deployment tooling notes and learning/evolution component design authority (offline feature plane, model factory, model/policy registry) for conceptual understanding.

* 09:41AM
  - Added Learning + Evolution narrative section to flow-narrative-platform-design.md (OFS replay/as-of, MF manifest-only inputs, MPR governed activation).

* 10:03AM
  - Pinned P0.1–P0.4 answers in learning_and_evolution.pre-design_decisions.md (replay basis, dataset fingerprint, label cut policy, join scope).

* 10:04AM
  - Removed "Pin (P0):" prefixes from P0.1–P0.4 answers in learning_and_evolution.pre-design_decisions.md.

* 10:05AM
  - Added P0.5–P0.8 answers in learning_and_evolution.pre-design_decisions.md (feature authority + parity, eval harness/PASS, bundle contents/compatibility, activation scope).

* 10:08AM
  - Added P1 + Additional answers in learning_and_evolution.pre-design_decisions.md (monitoring/retrain, retention, governance, data quality, sampling, label delay, feature drift, model risk, cost, multi-run, approvals).

* 10:26AM
  - Closed remaining Learning + Evolution pre-design gaps (ScopeKey mode, origin_offset shape, EB accelerator rule, label_maturity_days field, non-bypassable PASS gate).

* 11:05AM
  - Reviewed run_and_operate.pre-design_decisions.md for alignment with pinned planes and obs/gov posture; no edits made.

* 11:08AM
  - Locked Run/Operate pins (writer-boundary authz + actor_id enforcement, run-config freeze enforcement, evidence ref access mechanisms per env).

* 11:48AM
  - Added platform-wide v0 environment resource/tooling reference (plane-by-plane + meta layers).

* 11:51AM
  - Refocused v0 environment resource/tooling reference to Control & Ingress only.

* 12:37PM
  - Reviewed v0_environment_resource_tooling_map.md for accuracy vs pinned decisions and current wiring; noted minor clarifications (control bus topic vs stream, unpinned RTDL default substrate).

* 12:45PM
  - Patched Control & Ingress v0 tooling map (control bus topic vs stream, removed Archive mention from C&I ladder).

* 01:31PM
  - Read control_and_ingress.pre-design_decision.md and v0_environment_resource_tooling_map.md to prep for Control & Ingress plane assessment.

* 01:45PM
  - Reviewed platform + SR/WSP/IG/EB build plans/impl_actual for Control & Ingress comparison against control_and_ingress.pre-design_decision.md; preparing gap/mismatch matrix.
