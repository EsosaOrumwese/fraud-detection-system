  - Added detailed P0 answers to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (CaseSubjectKey, CaseTrigger shape, idempotency keys, evidence refs, ActionIntent contract, LabelSubjectKey, effective/observed time rules, writer boundary, commit/ack).

* 02:35AM
  - Added detailed P1 answers to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (SLA posture, reconciliation counters/report, security/actor attribution).

* 02:35AM

* 02:43AM
  - Applied P0 tightenings to case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (CaseSubjectKey-only case_id, LabelSubjectKey=(platform_run_id,event_id), stable label_assertion_id, LS writer idempotency+payload_hash, source_type+actor_id precedence).

* 02:46AM
  - Applied minimal contradiction fixes in case_and_labels.pre-design_decision.md (case create dedupe key, label_assertion_id idempotency, external truth ingestion dedupe).
