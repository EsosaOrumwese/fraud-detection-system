  - Added pre-change reasoning entries to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md`

    3) IEG DF-family graph-irrelevant classification,
    4) targeted OFP/IEG tests,
    5) platform v0 doc pin.
* 2:28PM
  - Applied step 1 (IG):
    - updated `config/platform/ig/partitioning_profiles_v0.yaml`:

        - `ig.partitioning.v0.rtdl.decision`
        - `ig.partitioning.v0.rtdl.action_intent`
  - Applied step 2 (OFP):
    - updated `src/fraud_detection/online_feature_plane/projector.py`:
      - added explicit ignore set for `decision_response` and `action_intent`,
      - suppressed these families before mutation, while advancing checkpoint with `ignored_event_type` metric.
  - Applied step 3 (IEG):
    - updated `config/platform/ieg/classification_v0.yaml`:
      - added `decision_response` and `action_intent` under `graph_irrelevant`.

    - updated `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py` to assert `platform_run_id` key participation via fallback-path vectors.
  - Test pass details:
    - initial targeted run had one assertion failure due precedence misunderstanding (primary keys still dominate by design),
      then test was refined to fallback-path verification without changing requested profile ordering.
  - Validation:
    - `$env:PYTHONPATH='.;src'; python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py tests/services/online_feature_plane/test_phase2_projector.py tests/services/identity_entity_graph/test_projector_determinism.py -q` -> `12 passed`

  - IG parity health reached `GREEN` at `/v1/ops/health`.
  - 20-pass:
    - SR `scenario_run_id=8b32f4e42a82977d87fb1de1cf3772df`
    - WSP emitted `80` (`20/output` x 4 outputs)
    - CSFB intake `processed=60`
    - CSFB metrics for scenario: `join_hits=20`, `join_misses=0`, `apply_failures=0`, `binding_conflicts=0`.
  - 200-pass:
    - SR `scenario_run_id=c62f7c678b4866059a257239664fe1c4`

  - Continued engine realism remediation planning after path normalization to docs/reports/eda (no nested eports/reports).
  - Created Step 7 Wave-2 runbook:
    - docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step7_wave2_execution_runbook.md`n  - Step 7 includes:
    - Wave-2 scope lock (WP-017..WP-026),
    - coupled bundles (B1_1A, B2_1B, B3_2A, B4_5B_6B_3B) + ablation rules,

* 06:59PM
  - AL Phase 4 hardening started: enforcing retry pacing (sleep/backoff) inside execution engine to prevent tight-loop retry storms.
  - Pre-implementation decision logged in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.impl_actual.md`
  - Planned scope:
    - implement injectable sleeper in `execution.py` with policy-derived delays,
    - add targeted tests for enforced pacing and terminal no-sleep behavior,
    - rerun `tests/services/action_layer`.
* 07:00PM
  - Hardened AL Phase 4 retry semantics in `src/fraud_detection/action_layer/execution.py`:
    - retries now enforce policy-derived sleep pacing before next attempt via injectable sleeper.
    - added `backoff_for_attempt_ms(...)` to keep delay derivation explicit/validated.
  - Strengthened tests in `tests/services/action_layer/test_phase4_execution.py`:
    - asserted retry-path sleep calls (`0.1s`, `0.2s`),
    - asserted no-sleep on immediate terminal lane.
  - Validation:
    - `$env:PYTHONPATH='.;src'; python -m pytest tests/services/action_layer -q` -> `24 passed`.
  - Recorded full decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.impl_actual.md`.
* 07:01PM
  - Updated AL build plan wording for Phase 4 DoD clarity:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.build_plan.md`
    - DoD now states retry backoff is **enforced pacing**, not only supported.
* 07:04PM

  - Started AL Phase 6 planning (`checkpoints + replay determinism`).
  - Pre-implementation decisions captured in:
