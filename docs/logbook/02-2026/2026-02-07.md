* 02:48AM
  - Reviewed RTDL authorities for platform Phase 4.4 expansion (`flow-narrative-platform-design.md`, RTDL pre-design decisions, DF/DL/AL/DLA design-authority notes).
  - Appended pre-implementation planning entry to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` to lock approach before editing `platform.build_plan.md`.

* 02:50AM
  - Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md` Phase 4.4 into phased subsections `4.4.A` to `4.4.L` with executable DoD checklists for DF/DL.
  - Appended post-change consistency/closure notes to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` and kept 4.5 integration boundaries explicit.

* 02:53AM
  - Started DF/DL component-plan expansion work.
  - Appended pre-implementation planning entries to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.impl_actual.md`
  - Confirmed scope: expand DF and DL build plans phase-by-phase in alignment with platform `Phase 4.4`.

* 02:55AM
  - Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.build_plan.md` into an executable 8-phase DF v0 plan with explicit DoDs aligned to platform 4.4 and RTDL pre-design pins.
  - Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.build_plan.md` into an executable 8-phase DL v0 plan with explicit DoDs aligned to platform 4.4 posture gates and fail-closed semantics.
  - Appended post-change alignment entries to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.impl_actual.md`

* 02:57AM
  - Started DL Phase 1 implementation (contracts + policy profile authority).
  - Appended detailed pre-implementation plan entry to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.impl_actual.md` before code/config edits.

* 03:06AM
  - Implemented DL Phase 1 scaffolding and policy/profile authority:
    - added `src/fraud_detection/degrade_ladder/{contracts.py,config.py,__init__.py}`,
    - added `config/platform/dl/policy_profiles_v0.yaml` and `config/platform/dl/README.md`,
    - wired DL policy refs in `config/platform/profiles/{local,local_parity,dev,prod}.yaml`,
    - updated `config/platform/profiles/README.md`,
    - fixed schema formatting defect in `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/real_time_decision_loop/degrade_posture.schema.yaml`.
  - Added tests `tests/services/degrade_ladder/test_phase1_contracts.py` and `tests/services/degrade_ladder/test_phase1_policy_profiles.py`.
  - Validation: `python -m pytest tests/services/degrade_ladder -q` -> `7 passed`.

* 03:08AM
  - Re-ran DL Phase 1 test suite after contract helper hardening (`python -m pytest tests/services/degrade_ladder -q` -> `7 passed`).
  - Verified profile policy loader resolves expected profiles with `PYTHONPATH=.;src` smoke check and parsed all `config/platform/profiles/*.yaml` files successfully.
