## 2026-02-28 00:05:20 +00:00 - M13.F blocker closure start (dev_full)
- Verified latest M13.F fail-closed summary from durable evidence:
  - execution: `m13f_teardown_execution_20260227T235508Z`
  - `overall_pass=false`, `blocker_count=3`, `verdict=HOLD_REMEDIATE`.
- Confirmed blocker surfaces were IAM control-plane denials:
  - `eks:list_nodegroups`
  - `sagemaker:list_endpoints_before`
  - `sagemaker:list_endpoints_after`.
- Decided to preserve fail-closed teardown semantics and remediate IAM policy (no advisory downgrade).

## 2026-02-28 00:06:35 +00:00 - IAM remediation materialized for M13.F
- Updated `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops/main.tf` policy `GitHubActionsM6FRemoteDevFull` to add:
  - `eks:ListNodegroups`, `eks:UpdateNodegroupConfig`, `eks:DescribeUpdate`
  - `sagemaker:ListEndpoints`, `sagemaker:DescribeEndpoint`, `sagemaker:DeleteEndpoint`
- Preserved prior M12d IAM statements in Terraform source to avoid drift deletion:
  - `M12dEKSDescribeCluster`
  - `M12dKafkaDataPlaneProof`
- Executed targeted Terraform materialization:
  - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_full/ops validate`
  - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_full/ops plan -input=false -lock-timeout=120s "-target=aws_iam_role_policy.github_actions_m6f_remote" -out tfplan_m13f_iam_targeted`
  - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_full/ops apply -input=false tfplan_m13f_iam_targeted`
- Result: `1 changed, 0 destroyed`.

## 2026-02-28 00:11:40 +00:00 - M13.G managed lane implementation started
- Expanded deep-plan contract for `M13.G` with explicit entry checks, residual-matrix logic, run-scoped residual-scan publication, and readability matrix requirements.
- Implemented workflow extension in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m13_managed.yml`:
  - new mode: `residual_readability_closure` (bound to `m13_subphase=G`),
  - new input: `upstream_m13f_execution`,
  - mode routing + env propagation + blocker/phase mappings,
  - execution branch emits:
    - `m13g_post_teardown_readability_snapshot.json`,
    - `m13g_blocker_register.json`,
    - `m13g_execution_summary.json`.
- Fail-closed logic pinned in code:
  - `M13-B7` for residual runtime risk / residual-scan publication failure,
  - `M13-B8` for unreadable retained/full-verdict/upstream evidence surfaces.
## 2026-02-28 00:12:10 +00:00 - M13.G managed lane materialized and released
- Confirmed upstream gate from M13.F is clean:
  - `m13f_teardown_execution_20260228T000326Z`
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M13.G_READY`.
- Expanded `M13.G` deep plan with explicit entry checks, residual-matrix rules, run-scoped residual-scan publication, and readability DoDs.
- Implemented `residual_readability_closure` mode in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m13_managed.yml` and added `upstream_m13f_execution` input.
- Workflow-only release for managed execution:
  - commit `9c44ee7e8`
  - message `ci: add managed M13.G residual/readability closure mode`
  - pushed to `origin/migrate-dev`.

## 2026-02-28 00:13:10 +00:00 - M13.G execution closed green

  - `residual_scan_published=true`
  - readability checks pass.
## 2026-02-28 00:15:40 +00:00 - M13.H planning start
- Verified upstream M13.G is blocker-free and ready for M13.H entry.
- Decided to materialize dedicated managed mode `post_teardown_cost_guardrail_closure` for `m13_subphase=H`.
- Planned checks: upstream gate validation, residual closure continuity, idle posture re-check (EKS/ECS/EMR/SageMaker), run-scoped teardown-cost snapshot publish/readback, fail-closed on any residual/cost publication drift.
## 2026-02-28 00:17:05 +00:00 - M13.H managed mode materialized
- Expanded M13.H deep plan with explicit entry checks, residual continuity checks, idle posture checks, and run-scoped teardown cost snapshot publication/readback DoDs.
- Implemented workflow mode `post_teardown_cost_guardrail_closure` in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m13_managed.yml`:
  - bound to `m13_subphase=H`,
  - added `upstream_m13g_execution` input,
  - fail-closed `M13-B9` idle/cost-guardrail logic.
- Workflow-only release commit pushed:
  - `98be002fb`

## 2026-02-28 00:18:20 +00:00 - M13.H run closed green
- Managed run:
  - workflow `dev_full_m13_managed.yml`
  - run id `22508967026`
  - execution id `m13h_cost_guardrail_20260228T001807Z`

## 2026-02-28 00:21:10 +00:00 - M13.I planning start
- Confirmed M13.H is blocker-free and entry-ready for M13.I.
- Expanded deep-plan M13.I execution contract with explicit handle closure, envelope/receipt publication, readback checks, and M13-B10 fail-closed semantics.
- Next: materialize managed workflow mode `phase_cost_outcome_closure` for `m13_subphase=I`, then execute and close only on `M13.J_READY`.

## 2026-02-28 00:26:40 +00:00 - M13.I first run failed closed (`M13-B10`)
- Managed run: `22509104250` (execution `m13i_phase_cost_outcome_20260228T002428Z`).
- Failure: `overall_pass=false`, `blocker_count=1`, blocker `M13-B10` (`One or more budget threshold handles missing/invalid`).
- Root cause isolated from artifact snapshot:
  - numeric budget pins resolved as null due to string-only parsing path in workflow helper (`get_handle_float` -> `get_handle_string`).

## 2026-02-28 00:27:35 +00:00 - M13.I remediation shipped
- Patched `.github/workflows/dev_full_m13_managed.yml` `get_handle_float()` to parse raw numeric handles directly and reject bool.
- Workflow-only commit/push:
  - `8c8757068`
  - `ci: fix M13.I budget handle parsing for numeric pins`.

## 2026-02-28 00:29:20 +00:00 - M13.I rerun green
- Managed rerun: `22509198947` (execution `m13i_phase_cost_outcome_20260228T002906Z`).
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blocker_count=0`
  - `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M13_J`
  - `next_gate=M13.J_READY`
- Evidence prefix:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m13i_phase_cost_outcome_20260228T002906Z/`
- Verified in snapshot:
  - `monthly_limit=300.0`, alerts `120.0/210.0/270.0`.

## 2026-02-28 00:33:10 +00:00 - M13.J planning expansion
- Confirmed no carry-over blockers from last execution:
  - upstream `M13.I` (`m13i_phase_cost_outcome_20260228T002906Z`) is pass with `blocker_count=0`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M13_J`, `next_gate=M13.J_READY`.
- Expanded `M13.J` plan with explicit closure checks:
  - `M13.A..M13.I` summary transition parity,
  - non-gate acceptance (`M13.D` final verdict readability, `M13.H` guardrail continuity, `M13.I` cost-outcome continuity),
  - run-scope continuity for `platform_run_id/scenario_run_id` across `M13.D/H/I`,
  - terminal verdict contract (`M13_COMPLETE_GREEN`, `DEV_FULL_TRACK_COMPLETE`).
- Next action: materialize managed `M13.J` mode (`final_closure_sync`) and execute full closure.

## 2026-02-28 00:37:20 +00:00 - M13.J managed mode materialized
- Updated workflow `.github/workflows/dev_full_m13_managed.yml`:
  - added `execution_mode=final_closure_sync`,
  - added `upstream_m13i_execution` input,
  - added fail-closed validation (`final_closure_sync` only for `m13_subphase=J`),
  - added managed execution branch for `M13.J` closure sync.
- M13.J execution branch enforces:
  - `M13.A..M13.I` summary parity and transition chain checks,
  - non-gate acceptance checks (`M13.D` full verdict readability, `M13.H` guardrail continuity, `M13.I` phase cost-outcome continuity),
  - run-scope continuity across `M13.D/H/I`,
  - terminal closure outputs + pass contract (`M13_COMPLETE_GREEN`, `DEV_FULL_TRACK_COMPLETE`).
- Static check:
  - embedded Python compile validation passed (`PY_COMPILE_OK`).

## 2026-02-28 00:39:20 +00:00 - M13.J run closed green
- Managed run:
  - workflow `dev_full_m13_managed.yml`
  - run id `22509404836`

- Closure verification:
  - `M13.A..M13.I` source-matrix parity all pass,
  - non-gate acceptance checks all pass (full verdict readability, guardrail continuity, phase cost-outcome continuity, run-scope consistency).

## 2026-02-28 00:49:40 +00:00 - On-demand teardown verification executed
- Teardown chain rerun on managed lane:
  - `M13.F` run `22509573483` -> `m13f_teardown_execution_20260228T004654Z` (pass),
  - `M13.G` run `22509594844` -> `m13g_residual_readability_20260228T004758Z` (pass),
