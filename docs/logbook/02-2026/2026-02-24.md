## 2026-02-24 04:22:57 +00:00 - M4 planning started and deep plan materialized
- Started M4 planning after M3 closure (`ADVANCE_TO_M4` posture already established).
- Detected planning gap:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md` was missing.
- Implemented planning bootstrap:
  - created `platform.M4.build_plan.md` with execution-grade structure:
    - authority inputs and scope boundary,
    - anti-cram capability-lane matrix,
    - subphase decomposition `M4.A..M4.J`,
    - fail-closed blocker taxonomy,
    - evidence contract,
    - completion checklist and exit criteria.
- Updated master plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - M4 status moved to `IN_PROGRESS` (planning active),
  - added M4 planning posture and subphase progress checklist.
- Scope in this step:
  - planning/documentation only; no runtime execution.

## 2026-02-24 04:27:48 +00:00 - M4.A planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M4.A` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
- Added for M4.A:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - decision pins,
  - verification command catalog (`M4A-V1..V5`),
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M4A-B1..M4A-B6`),
  - evidence contract and closure rule,
  - planning status.
- Boundary decision recorded:
  - M4.A blocks on unresolved required **P2 runtime** handles only; out-of-scope future-phase handles are tracked but non-blocking for this lane.
- Synced master plan posture:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - added explicit note that `M4.A` is planning-expanded.
- Scope in this step:
  - planning/documentation only; no M4.A runtime execution yet.

## 2026-02-24 04:31:14 +00:00 - M4.A execution started
- Starting full `M4.A` authority/handle-closure execution.
- Pre-run locks:
  - M3 gate is explicit and green (`ADVANCE_TO_M4`),
  - required M4.A handle set pinned to P2 runtime boundary (not all-phase registry handles),
  - single-active-path runtime law enforced as hard gate.
- Planned outputs:
  - `m4a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - `m4a_required_handle_matrix.json`
  - `m4a_execution_summary.json`
- Publication target:
  - `s3://<S3_EVIDENCE_BUCKET>/evidence/dev_full/run_control/<m4a_execution_id>/...`

## 2026-02-24 04:32:45 +00:00 - M4.A attempt #1 blocker and remediation decision
- Attempt `m4a_20260224T043207Z` failed with `M4A-B1`.
- Root cause:
  - required-set checker used `RUNTIME_DEFAULT_STREAM_LANE`,
  - canonical registry key is `RUNTIME_DEFAULT_STREAM_ENGINE`.
- Decision:
  - no registry alias added (avoid duplicate semantics),
  - update required-set checker to canonical key and rerun M4.A immediately.
- Failed-attempt artifacts retained as audit evidence.

## 2026-02-24 04:34:12 +00:00 - M4.A executed and closed green
- Authoritative execution id:
  - `m4a_20260224T043334Z`
- Execution lane:
  - reran M4.A with canonical stream runtime key `RUNTIME_DEFAULT_STREAM_ENGINE`,
  - validated required P2 handle set closure,
  - validated runtime-path law and M3 entry dependency,
  - published closure artifacts durably.
- Outcome:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blockers=[]`
  - `next_gate=M4.A_READY`
- Key metrics:
  - required handles=`33`, resolved=`33`, unresolved=`0`
  - runtime-path contract=`PASS`
  - M3 gate (`ADVANCE_TO_M4`) = `PASS`
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m4/m4a_20260224T043334Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m4a_20260224T043334Z/`
- Published artifacts:
  - `m4a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - `m4a_required_handle_matrix.json`
  - `m4a_execution_summary.json`
- Plan sync:
  - marked `M4.A` complete in deep and master M4 plans.

## 2026-02-24 04:38:19 +00:00 - M4.B planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M4.B` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
- Added for M4.B:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - runtime-path decision pins (single-active + no in-phase switch),
  - verification command catalog (`M4B-V1..V5`),
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M4B-B1..M4B-B7`),
  - evidence contract + closure rule,
  - planning status.
- Boundary/policy decision recorded:
  - stream and ingress lanes remain managed-first defaults,
  - EKS path may be active only for differentiating lanes per pinned policy.
- Synced master plan posture:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - added explicit note that `M4.B` is planning-expanded.
- Scope in this step:
  - planning/documentation only; no M4.B runtime execution yet.

## 2026-02-24 04:41:50 +00:00 - M4.B execution started
- Starting full `M4.B` runtime-path selection + manifest freeze lane.
- Pre-run locks:
  - M4.A gate PASS (`m4a_20260224T043334Z`),
  - single-active-path + no in-phase switch laws enforced,
  - explicit fallback declarations required for inactive paths.
- Planned outputs:
  - `m4b_runtime_path_manifest.json`
  - `m4b_lane_path_selection_matrix.json`
  - `m4b_execution_summary.json`

## 2026-02-24 04:45:40 +00:00 - M4.B executed and closed green
- Authoritative execution id:
  - `m4b_20260224T044454Z`
- Execution lane:
  - built immutable runtime-path manifest,
  - enforced one active path per lane,
  - enforced explicit inactive fallback declarations,
  - enforced selective-EKS policy conformance,
  - published artifacts durably.
- Outcome:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blockers=[]`
  - `next_gate=M4.B_READY`
- Key metrics:
  - lane_count=`5`
  - single_active_path_pass=`true`
  - eks_policy_conformance_pass=`true`
  - manifest_sha256=`fa5399d7c5fdee0e17b5f89bfc52958d7c5685cdb099a7eb16b0c21b4cc8f249`
- Operational note:
  - first shell invocation hit wrapper timeout; rerun with higher timeout completed successfully with no semantic blockers.
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m4/m4b_20260224T044454Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m4b_20260224T044454Z/`
- Published artifacts:
  - `m4b_runtime_path_manifest.json`
  - `m4b_lane_path_selection_matrix.json`
  - `m4b_execution_summary.json`

## 2026-02-24 04:24:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 planning expanded (date-corrected entry)
- Recorded the same POPT.1 planning expansion under the current day file for timestamp consistency.
- Scope remains planning-only (no runtime code changes in this step).
- Build-plan anchor:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.build_plan.md` (`POPT.1.1`..`POPT.1.5`).

## 2026-02-24 04:28:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 execution design lock (pre-code)
- Started full `POPT.1` execution lane.
- Captured pre-code design lock in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.impl_actual.md`.
- Pinned constraints before code edits:
  - preserve output schemas and RNG event semantics,
  - preserve fail-closed checks,
  - optimize by data-layout and emit-path redesign (no policy/threshold edits).
- Next action:
  - patch `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py` for `POPT.1.2`/`POPT.1.3`/`POPT.1.4`.

## 2026-02-24 04:35:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 core S3 refactor landed
- Implemented `POPT.1.2/1.3/1.4` in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py`.
- Key changes:
  - one-time deterministic per-cell account vector ordering,
  - prefix-sum scheme block assignment replacing per-row queue churn,
  - columnar instrument buffering + derived link frame at flush.
- Preserved:
  - fail-closed checks and output schemas,
  - RNG stream/event contract.
- Validation:
  - compile check passed for modified `S3` runner.
- Next action:
  - run fresh witness lane and capture `S3` perf delta vs POPT.0 baseline.

## 2026-02-24 05:06:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 witness failed; candidate reverted fail-closed
- Executed fresh witness lane:
  - run_id: `6a29f01be03f4b509959a9237d2aec76`,
  - staged from `2204694f83dc4bc7bfa5d04274b9f211`,
  - executed `S3 -> S4 -> S5`.
- Perf evidence:
  - `S3=433.266s` vs POPT.0 `312.109s` (`+38.82%`, regression),
  - `S3 allocate_instruments=400.703s` vs baseline `287.359s` (hotspot regression),
  - `S4=104.328s` (`+21.36%` vs POPT.0),
  - `S5=1058.344s` (`+357.38%` vs POPT.0).
- Decision:
  - `HOLD_POPT1` (closure target not met).
- Safety action:
  - reverted `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py` to baseline implementation and recompiled.
- Plan posture:
  - do not advance to `POPT.2`; next lane should be `POPT.1R` micro-optimization with isolated per-substep validation.

## 2026-02-24 05:13:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1R planning lock opened
- Added explicit `POPT.1R` recovery lane to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.build_plan.md`.
- Captured pre-code reasoning/constraints in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.impl_actual.md`.
- POPT.1R execution intent:
  - low-blast `S3` rollback-to-fast mechanic,
  - quick `S3` witness gate first,
  - full `S3->S5` witness only if quick gate improves.

## 2026-02-24 05:18:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1R.1 implemented
- Updated:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py`.
- Change class:
  - low-blast rollback of regressive `S3` allocation/emit mechanics.
- Specific mechanics:
  - restored queue-based scheme assignment in hot loop,
  - restored row-buffer emit path (`instrument_buffer`/`link_buffer` tuple rows),
  - removed block-slicing scheme assignment and column-buffer list expansion path.
- Invariants preserved:
  - deterministic output order, schema, RNG semantics, fail-closed guards.
- Validation:
  - compile check passed.
- Next:
  - run fresh `S3` quick witness (`POPT.1R.2`) and gate on measured hotspot movement.

## 2026-02-24 05:42:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1R execution closed (`HOLD_POPT1R`)
- Candidate run:
  - `b68127889d454dc4ac0ae496475c99c5` (staged from `2204694f83dc4bc7bfa5d04274b9f211`).
- Quick gate (`S3` only):
  - `S3_total=418.172s` vs failed witness `433.266s` (`-3.48%`).
  - `S3 allocate_instruments=385.203s` vs `400.703s` (`-3.87%`).
- Full gate (`S3->S4->S5`) vs `POPT.0`:
  - `S3 +33.98%`, `S4 +19.81%`, `S5 +338.87%`.
  - segment elapsed `1536.672s` vs budget `540s` (fail).
- Decision:
  - `HOLD_POPT1R`.
  - `POPT.2` remains blocked.

## 2026-02-24 05:45:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A run retention prune applied
- Applied keep-set prune at `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6A`.
- Kept:
  - `2204694f83dc4bc7bfa5d04274b9f211` (baseline authority),
  - `b68127889d454dc4ac0ae496475c99c5` (current candidate).
- Removed:
  - `6a29f01be03f4b509959a9237d2aec76` (superseded failed witness).

## 2026-02-24 04:54:33 +00:00 - M4.C planning expanded (identity/IAM conformance)
- Expanded `M4.C` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`.
- Added execution-grade planning surfaces:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - identity/secrets decision pins,
  - verification catalog (`M4C-V1..V5`),
  - fail-closed blockers (`M4C-B1..M4C-B7`),
  - evidence contract and closure rule.
- Synced M4 posture in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`.
- Key planning callout (pre-exec risk):
  - `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_*` handle family likely unresolved and may trigger `M4C-B2` until pinned/materialized.
- Scope:
  - planning/documentation only; M4.C execution has not started.

## 2026-02-24 05:00:49 +00:00 - M4.C execution started (fail-closed)
- Started full `M4.C` identity/IAM conformance execution.
- Live precheck findings before run:
  - unresolved role handles: `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_IG`, `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_RTDL`, `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_DECISION_LANE`, `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_CASE_LABELS`, `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_OBS_GOV`.
  - missing SSM runtime dependency paths: aurora (`endpoint/reader/username/password`) and redis endpoint.
  - present SSM runtime dependency paths: MSK bootstrap brokers and IG API key.
- Execution decision:
  - run fail-closed and emit full `m4c_*` evidence pack without inventing placeholder values.
  - let blocker taxonomy (`M4C-B*`) carry remediation ownership explicitly.

## 2026-02-24 05:02:53 +00:00 - M4.C attempt #1 parser blocker and rerun decision
- Attempt `m4c_20260224T050216Z` produced artifacts but exposed a checker defect:
  - role-handle assignment parser failed on registry lines with trailing annotations (e.g. `(materialized in M2.E)`).
- Impact:
  - materialized role handles were incorrectly flagged unresolved, contaminating blocker signal.
- Decision:
  - retain attempt #1 as audit evidence,
  - fix parser and rerun M4.C immediately for authoritative blocker posture.

## 2026-02-24 05:05:20 +00:00 - M4.C rerun executed (authoritative)
- Authoritative run:
  - `m4c_20260224T050409Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=false`
  - `blockers=[M4C-B2,M4C-B4,M4C-B6]`
  - `next_gate=BLOCKED`
- Local evidence:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m4/m4c_20260224T050409Z/`
- Durable evidence:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m4c_20260224T050409Z/`
- Blocker specifics:
  - `M4C-B2`: unresolved `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_*` handles for differentiating-services lane.
  - `M4C-B4`: missing Aurora/Redis SSM paths (`/fraud-platform/dev_full/aurora/*`, `/fraud-platform/dev_full/redis/endpoint`).
  - `M4C-B6`: role-binding matrix incomplete because unresolved IRSA handles remain.
- Next remediation direction:
  - materialize missing ops SSM parameters via `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops`,
  - materialize and pin IRSA role handles, then rerun M4.C.

## 2026-02-24 05:10:40 +00:00 - M4.C remediation lane 1 executed (ops SSM materialization)
- Ran `terraform plan/apply` in `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops`.
- Materialized missing runtime SSM paths:
  - `/fraud-platform/dev_full/aurora/endpoint`
  - `/fraud-platform/dev_full/aurora/reader_endpoint`
  - `/fraud-platform/dev_full/aurora/username`
  - `/fraud-platform/dev_full/aurora/password`
  - `/fraud-platform/dev_full/redis/endpoint`
- Also materialized `ROLE_MWAA_EXECUTION` per ops stack contract.

## 2026-02-24 05:14:55 +00:00 - M4.C remediation lane 2 executed (runtime IRSA materialization)
- Patched runtime IaC:
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/versions.tf` (`tls` provider added),
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/variables.tf` (IRSA role/service-account/namespace variables),
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/main.tf` (EKS OIDC provider + IRSA roles + baseline SSM-read policies),
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/outputs.tf` (`ROLE_EKS_IRSA_*` outputs + handle materialization map updates).
- Applied runtime stack successfully; created:
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-irsa-ig`
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-irsa-rtdl`
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-irsa-decision-lane`
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-irsa-case-labels`
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-irsa-obs-gov`
- Updated registry handle pins:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` now assigns concrete ARN values for `ROLE_EKS_IRSA_*`.

## 2026-02-24 05:18:51 +00:00 - M4.C remediation closure rerun passed
- Closure run:
  - `m4c_20260224T051711Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `next_gate=M4.C_READY`
- Key metrics:
  - resolved roles `11/11`,
  - present secret paths `7/7`,
  - binding matrix complete `true`.
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m4/m4c_20260224T051711Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m4c_20260224T051711Z/`
- Plan sync:
  - `platform.M4.build_plan.md` marks `M4.C` complete and records blocked->remediated->pass trail.
  - `platform.build_plan.md` marks `M4.C` complete in sub-phase progress.

## 2026-02-24 05:34:32 +00:00 - M4.D planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M4.D` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`.
- Added execution-grade planning surfaces:
  - decision-completeness precheck (M4.C PASS gate),
  - dependency-scope/pin laws,
  - verification catalog (`M4D-V1..V6`),
  - fail-closed blockers (`M4D-B1..M4D-B8`),
  - evidence contract + closure rule.
- Planning callouts:
  - likely `M4D-B4`: datastore endpoints may still be placeholder/non-routable.
  - likely `M4D-B5`: observability surfaces may be partially materialized before lane start.
- Synced master M4 posture in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`.
- Scope:
  - planning/documentation only; M4.D execution not started yet.

## 2026-02-24 05:38:39 +00:00 - M4.D execution started
- Entry gate pinned:
  - `M4.C` pass at `m4c_20260224T051711Z`.
- Execution strategy pinned before probes:
  - use control-plane dependency reachability for M4.D (existence/readability/discoverability via pinned handles),
  - reserve deep runtime/pod connectivity checks for M4.E lane health checks.
- Blocker policy:
  - remediate any missing observability surface by materializing canonical bootstrap log-group under `/fraud-platform/dev_full`.

## 2026-02-24 05:42:08 +00:00 - M4.D attempt #1 blocked; remediation pinned
- Attempt run:
  - `m4d_20260224T054113Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=false`
  - `blockers=[M4D-B3,M4D-B5]`
- Failure details:
  - `M4D-B3`: stale registry handles (`MSK_CLUSTER_ARN`, `APIGW_IG_API_ID`) no longer resolve in AWS.
  - `M4D-B5`: zero log groups under `CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_PREFIX=/fraud-platform/dev_full`.
- Remediation decision:
  - repin stale handles from current Terraform outputs,
  - materialize a canonical observability bootstrap log-group through IaC (`infra/terraform/dev_full/ops`),
  - rerun M4.D for authoritative closure.

## 2026-02-24 05:44:05 +00:00 - M4.D remediation applied
- Registry repin completed in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - refreshed: `MSK_CLUSTER_ARN`, `MSK_BOOTSTRAP_BROKERS_SASL_IAM`, `MSK_CLIENT_SUBNET_IDS`, `MSK_SECURITY_GROUP_ID`, `APIGW_IG_API_ID`.
- IaC observability remediation completed:
  - added `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.runtime_bootstrap` in `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops/main.tf`,
  - applied ops stack and created `/fraud-platform/dev_full/runtime-bootstrap` with retention `14`.

## 2026-02-24 05:46:16 +00:00 - M4.D closure rerun passed
- Closure run:
  - `m4d_20260224T054449Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `next_gate=M4.D_READY`
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m4/m4d_20260224T054449Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m4d_20260224T054449Z/`
- Plan sync:
  - `platform.M4.build_plan.md` updated with blocked->remediated->pass execution trail.
  - `platform.build_plan.md` marks `M4.D` complete.

## 2026-02-24 05:54:41 +00:00 - M4.E planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M4.E` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`.
- Added execution-grade planning surfaces:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - managed-surface and run-scope decision pins,
  - verification catalog (`M4E-V1..V8`),
  - fail-closed blockers (`M4E-B1..M4E-B6`),
  - M4.E evidence contract + closure rule.
- Synced M4 posture in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`.
- Scope:
  - planning/documentation only; M4.E execution starts next.

## 2026-02-24 05:55:00 +00:00 - M4.E execution started
- Entry gate pinned:
  - `M4.D` PASS at `m4d_20260224T054449Z`.
- Inputs locked:
  - active lane manifest (`m4b_20260224T044454Z`),
  - M3 handoff run identity,
  - dev_full handles registry.
- Execution strategy:
  - run fail-closed with explicit lane-health + run-scope probes,
  - produce local + durable `m4e_*` evidence pack,
  - emit blockers explicitly if any drift appears.

## 2026-02-24 05:55:36 +00:00 - M4.E pre-execution handle gap closed
- Detected decision hole before execution:
  - `SSM_IG_API_KEY_PATH` required by M4.E but not explicitly assigned in registry.
- Applied fail-closed remediation:
  - added named handle assignment in `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`.
- Outcome:
  - ingress key-source resolution is now explicit for M4.E probes.

## 2026-02-24 05:58:27 +00:00 - M4.E attempt #1 blocked; ingress base-url drift pinned
- Attempt run:
  - `m4e_20260224T055735Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=false`
  - `blockers=[M4E-B2,M4E-B3]`
- Root cause:
  - `IG_BASE_URL` remained templated (`{api_id}`), causing invalid ingress probe URLs.
- Remediation:
  - repinned `IG_BASE_URL` to concrete API endpoint in handles registry,
  - rerun M4.E for authoritative closure.

## 2026-02-24 06:01:05 +00:00 - M4.E ingress routing remediation staged
- Structural drift confirmed:
  - API stage `v1` + route keys `/v1/...` forced `/v1/v1/...` externally.
- Remediation patches applied:
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/main.tf` route keys now `/ops/health` and `/ingest/push`.
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime/lambda/ig_handler.py` route matches aligned.
  - handles registry aligned to stage-safe URL+paths.
- Next:
  - apply runtime Terraform,
  - rerun M4.E and close if blocker-free.

## 2026-02-24 06:01:38 +00:00 - M4.E ingress remediation applied in runtime stack
- Ran `terraform plan/apply` at `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime`.
- Applied changes:
  - API routes now `/ops/health` and `/ingest/push`.
  - IG Lambda route matcher updated accordingly.
- Next:
