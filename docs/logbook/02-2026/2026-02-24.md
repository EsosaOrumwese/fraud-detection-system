## 2026-02-24 04:22:57 +00:00 - M4 planning started and deep plan materialized
- Started M4 planning after M3 closure (`ADVANCE_TO_M4` posture already established).
- Detected planning gap:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md` was missing.
- Implemented planning bootstrap:
  - created `platform.M4.build_plan.md` with execution-grade structure:
    - authority inputs and scope boundary,
    - anti-cram capability-lane matrix,
    - subphase decomposition `M4.A..M4.J`,
    - fail-closed blocker taxonomy,
    - evidence contract,
    - completion checklist and exit criteria.
- Updated master plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - M4 status moved to `IN_PROGRESS` (planning active),
  - added M4 planning posture and subphase progress checklist.
- Scope in this step:
  - planning/documentation only; no runtime execution.

## 2026-02-24 04:27:48 +00:00 - M4.A planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M4.A` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
- Added for M4.A:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - decision pins,
  - verification command catalog (`M4A-V1..V5`),
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M4A-B1..M4A-B6`),
  - evidence contract and closure rule,
  - planning status.
- Boundary decision recorded:
  - M4.A blocks on unresolved required **P2 runtime** handles only; out-of-scope future-phase handles are tracked but non-blocking for this lane.
- Synced master plan posture:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - added explicit note that `M4.A` is planning-expanded.
- Scope in this step:
  - planning/documentation only; no M4.A runtime execution yet.

## 2026-02-24 04:24:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 planning expanded (date-corrected entry)
- Recorded the same POPT.1 planning expansion under the current day file for timestamp consistency.
- Scope remains planning-only (no runtime code changes in this step).
- Build-plan anchor:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.build_plan.md` (`POPT.1.1`..`POPT.1.5`).

## 2026-02-24 04:28:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 execution design lock (pre-code)
- Started full `POPT.1` execution lane.
- Captured pre-code design lock in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_6A.impl_actual.md`.
- Pinned constraints before code edits:
  - preserve output schemas and RNG event semantics,
  - preserve fail-closed checks,
  - optimize by data-layout and emit-path redesign (no policy/threshold edits).
- Next action:
  - patch `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py` for `POPT.1.2`/`POPT.1.3`/`POPT.1.4`.

## 2026-02-24 04:35:00 +00:00 - Segment 6A POPT.1 core S3 refactor landed
- Implemented `POPT.1.2/1.3/1.4` in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l3/seg_6A/s3_instruments/runner.py`.
- Key changes:
  - one-time deterministic per-cell account vector ordering,
  - prefix-sum scheme block assignment replacing per-row queue churn,
  - columnar instrument buffering + derived link frame at flush.
- Preserved:
  - fail-closed checks and output schemas,
  - RNG stream/event contract.
- Validation:
  - compile check passed for modified `S3` runner.
- Next action:
  - run fresh witness lane and capture `S3` perf delta vs POPT.0 baseline.
