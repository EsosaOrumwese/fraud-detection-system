## 2026-02-26 01:32:00 +00:00 - M7.P9.A plan/execution lane closure (`m7g`)
- Planned `P9.A` as explicit entry gate before `DF/AL/DLA` execution in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M7.build_plan.md`
- Implemented managed lane `phase_mode=m7g` in:
  - `.github/workflows/dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`
- Workflow-only commit (current branch `migrate-dev`):
  - `ci: add managed m7g p9a entry lane`
- Dispatched authoritative run:
  - workflow run `22423991265`
  - execution id `m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blocker_count=0`
  - `next_gate=M7.F_READY`
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m7/_gh_run_22423991265_artifacts/p9a-entry-precheck-20260226T013600Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z/`
- Decision outcome:
  - `M7.P9.A` is closed green; `M7.F` can proceed to `P9.B` (`DF` lane closure).

## 2026-02-26 01:45:00 +00:00 - Opened M7.P9.B/C/D sequential execution plan
- Confirmed current run-scoped ingest sample is low (`total_receipts=18`), so strict throughput assertion would produce false blocker posture.
- Chosen lane pattern:
  - `m7h` (`P9.B DF`) -> `m7i` (`P9.C AL`) -> `m7j` (`P9.D DLA`) with upstream gate chaining.
- Chosen proof surfaces:
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/df_component_proof.json`
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/al_component_proof.json`
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/dla_component_proof.json`
- Chosen performance posture:
  - low-sample guarded throughput waiver (<200 sample),
  - lag/error/retry invariants still fail-closed.

## 2026-02-26 01:52:00 +00:00 - Implemented managed P9 component workflow lanes
- Updated `.github/workflows/dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`:
  - added `phase_mode=m7h/m7i/m7j`,
  - added `run_m7hij_remote` job for `P9.B/P9.C/P9.D` sequential execution.
- Added lane outputs:
  - `p9b_df_*`, `p9c_al_*`, `p9d_dla_*` run-control artifacts,
  - decision-lane component proofs under `DECISION_LANE_EVIDENCE_PATH_PATTERN`.
- Added `DLA` append-only probe write/readback guard.
- Verified YAML syntax locally (`YAML_OK`).

## 2026-02-26 01:56:00 +00:00 - Started P9.B managed execution (`m7h`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `M7.G_READY`.
- Sequential lock: `P9.C` and `P9.D` remain blocked until `P9.B` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:52:00 +00:00 - P9.B (`m7h`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424352180`
- Execution id: `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.G_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - DF component proof published under decision-lane run prefix.
- Next: start `P9.C` (`m7i`) with upstream execution `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`.

## 2026-02-26 02:03:00 +00:00 - Started P9.C managed execution (`m7i`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `M7.H_READY`.
- Sequential lock: `P9.D` remains blocked until `P9.C` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:54:00 +00:00 - P9.C (`m7i`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424410762`
- Execution id: `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.H_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - AL continuity and upstream proof chain checks passed,
  - `al_component_proof.json` published.
- Next: start `P9.D` (`m7j`) with upstream execution `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`.

## 2026-02-26 02:08:00 +00:00 - Started P9.D managed execution (`m7j`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `P9.E_READY`.
- Sequential lock: no P9 rollup start until `P9.D` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:56:00 +00:00 - P9.D (`m7j`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424458740`
- Execution id: `m7j_p9d_dla_component_20260226T015553Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=P9.E_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - upstream proof chain checks passed (`df` + `al` proofs),
  - append-only audit probe and `dla_component_proof.json` published.
- Outcome: `P9.B/P9.C/P9.D` component lanes are closed green; `P9.E` rollup is now the remaining P9 gate.

## 2026-02-26 02:12:00 +00:00 - Pinned non-waived throughput gate for P8/P9 production-readiness
- Added registry throughput-cert pins (including target `134,000,000 events/hour`, about `37,223 eps`).
- Marked current P8/P9 lane performance as provisional due `waived_low_sample` mode.
- Added fail-closed blockers:
  - `M7-B18` (M7 throughput cert missing/waived),
  - `M7P8-B8`,
  - `M7P9-B8`.
- Updated M7/P8/P9 plans so final production claim is blocked until non-waived throughput certification artifacts exist.

## 2026-02-26 02:29:00 +00:00 - Realigned throughput-cert gate to post-M7 (deferred, mandatory)
- Context:
  - user directed that throughput-cert should not block M7 functional wiring closure,
  - but it must remain mandatory for post-M7 non-soak production-scale validation.
- Actions:
  - patched `platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7P8-B8` -> `M7P8-D8` (deferred item),
    - updated P8 throughput section and exit-rule language.
  - patched `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7P9-B8` -> `M7P9-D8` (deferred item),
    - updated P9 throughput section and exit-rule language.
  - patched `platform.M7.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7-B18` -> `M7-D18` (deferred item),
    - removed active M7-blocking semantics for throughput-cert,
    - updated M7.H tasks/DoD/planning notes.
  - patched `platform.build_plan.md`:
    - M7 caveat now states post-M7 mandatory throughput-cert,
    - removed non-waived throughput line from M7 DoD anchors.
- Outcome:
  - M7 remains focused on functional closure,
  - production-scale throughput claim remains blocked until post-M7 non-soak certification is executed.

## 2026-02-26 02:33:00 +00:00 - Segment 6B P2.R4 witness executed; phase remains HOLD_P2_REOPEN_PERF
- Scope:
  - continue `6B` `P2.R4` (S2 runtime reopen lane) on fresh run `49582f7fafa441db97e3db82c6e80238`.
- Executed:
  - `make --no-print-directory segment6b-s4 RUNS_ROOT=\"runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B\" SEG6B_S4_RUN_ID=\"49582f...\"`
  - `make --no-print-directory segment6b-s5 RUNS_ROOT=\"runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B\" SEG6B_S5_RUN_ID=\"49582f...\"`

- Runtime witness:
  - `S2=232.08s`, `S3=368.06s`, `S4=482.50s`, `S5=21.05s`.
  - rail posture: `S2` FAIL (`<=150s` stretch), `S3` PASS, `S4` FAIL (`<=420s`), `S5` PASS.
- Realism witness:
  - scorer verdict unchanged: `PASS_HARD_ONLY`.
  - `T11,T13,T14,T15,T16,T21` unchanged/non-regressed vs baseline `bbbe...`.
- Artifacts emitted:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B/reports/segment6b_p0_realism_gateboard_49582f7fafa441db97e3db82c6e80238.json`

  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B/reports/segment6b_p2r4_closure_49582f7fafa441db97e3db82c6e80238.md`
- Decision:
  - keep phase posture `HOLD_P2_REOPEN_PERF`;
  - next reopen owner remains `S2` runtime redesign (timestamp/parquet hotspots), with S4 rail recheck on isolated-load witness.

## 2026-02-26 02:41:00 +00:00 - Opened Segment 6B P2.R5 (S2 timestamp/parquet hotspot closure)
- Planned `P2.R5` in the 6B build plan with explicit DoD and closure artifacts.
- Pinned implementation decision in `segment_6B.impl_actual.md`:
  - optimize `S2` timestamp parse path using fixed-format strict parsing,
  - optimize `S2` parquet write path via writer settings (disable stats),
  - keep schema/policy/scorer semantics unchanged.
- Next execution lane:
  - implement S2 code-path changes,
  - run fresh witness (`S2->S3->S4->S5`),
  - score and emit `segment6b_p2r5_closure_<run_id>`.

## 2026-02-26 03:16:00 +00:00 - Executed Segment 6B P2.R5; phase remains HOLD_P2_REOPEN_PERF
- Implemented `6B.S2` optimizations in `runner.py`:
  - fixed-format strict parse for response timestamp path (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%.6fZ`),
  - parquet write tuning (`statistics=False`, explicit row_group_size),
  - removed redundant event post-concat projection.
- Staged fresh witness run-id: `ac712b0b5e3f4ae5b5fd1a2af1662d4b` from authority `bbbe8850af334fa097d5770da339d713` with minimal prerequisite junctions + seeded `6B.S1` rng trace.
- Executed full chain:
  - `make segment6b-s2 ... SEG6B_S2_RUN_ID=ac712...`
  - `make segment6b-s3 ... SEG6B_S3_RUN_ID=ac712...`
  - `make segment6b-s4 ... SEG6B_S4_RUN_ID=ac712...`
  - `make segment6b-s5 ... SEG6B_S5_RUN_ID=ac712...`
- First-pass runtime:
  - `S2=227.36s` (improved; still above `<=150s` stretch rail),
  - `S3=400.42s` (fail),
  - `S4=405.50s` (pass),
  - `S5=19.83s` (pass).
- Immediate repeat check (`S3->S5` same run-id):
  - `S3=360.64s` pass, `S4=460.44s` fail, `S5=30.49s` fail-margin.
- Scored candidate:
  - `python tools/score_segment6b_p0_baseline.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B --run-id ac712... --out-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B/reports --merchant-class-glob runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92/data/layer2/5A/merchant_class_profile/**/*.parquet --arrival-events-glob runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92/data/layer2/5B/arrival_events/**/*.parquet`
  - verdict remains `PASS_HARD_ONLY` with non-regressed `T11,T13,T14,T15,T16,T21`.
- Artifacts:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B/reports/segment6b_p0_realism_gateboard_ac712b0b5e3f4ae5b5fd1a2af1662d4b.json`

- Storage hygiene:
  - pruned superseded staging run-id `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_6B/57e71bae298340dd83f2ccbd16b26a5a`.
- Decision:
  - keep `HOLD_P2_REOPEN_PERF` and reopen next S2 runtime lane.

## 2026-02-26 02:34:00 +00:00 - Planned + executed P9.E managed rollup (`m7k`)
- Gap identified:
  - `P9.E` was open, and managed workflow lacked a dedicated phase mode for rollup execution.
- Implementation decision:
  - add `phase_mode=m7k` to existing `dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml` rather than creating a new workflow.
  - reuse existing upstream id inputs (`upstream_m6d/m6g/m6h`) for `P9.B/P9.C/P9.D` lineage.
- Lane behavior implemented:
  - validates upstream summaries + blocker registers,
  - validates decision-lane proof triplet (`df/al/dla_component_proof.json`),
  - emits `p9e_*` artifact set,
  - fail-closed on verdict mismatch.
- Workflow execution:
  - run id: `22425281848`
  - execution id: `m7k_p9e_rollup_20260226T023154Z`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, `phase_verdict=ADVANCE_TO_P10`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.I_READY`.
- Durable evidence:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m7k_p9e_rollup_20260226T023154Z/`
- Planning/docs synced:
  - `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md` (`P9.E` now execution-grade + closed),
  - `platform.M7.build_plan.md` (`M7.H` marked complete),
  - `platform.build_plan.md` (`M7` posture reflects `P9.E` closure).

## 2026-02-26 02:46:00 +00:00 - Planned P10.A managed entry lane (`m7l`)
- Identified closure gap:
  - `P10.A` had no managed execution lane despite `M7.I` requiring deterministic entry precheck.
- Chosen implementation:
  - add `phase_mode=m7l` to `dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`.
  - use upstream `P9.E` execution id via `upstream_m6d_execution`.
- Fail-closed checks pinned:
  - upstream `p9e_execution_summary` must be `ADVANCE_TO_P10` + `M7.I_READY`,
  - required case/labels handles must resolve with no placeholders,
  - upstream SLO continuity for `CaseTriggerBridge/CM/LS` must be present.
- Planned outputs:
  - `p10a_entry_snapshot.json`,
  - `p10a_blocker_register.json`,
  - `p10a_component_slo_profile.json`,
  - `p10a_execution_summary.json`.
- Success gate:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=P10.B_READY`.

## 2026-02-26 02:53:00 +00:00 - Executed P10.A (`m7l`) and closed entry gate
- Workflow lane added and used:
  - `phase_mode=m7l` in `dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`.
- Run:
  - workflow run `22425458650`
  - execution id `m7l_p10a_entry_precheck_20260226T023945Z`
- Gate checks:
  - upstream `P9.E` verdict continuity passed (`ADVANCE_TO_P10`, `M7.I_READY`),
  - required handles resolved `15/15` (no missing/placeholder),
  - `m7a` SLO continuity for `CaseTriggerBridge/CM/LS` present.
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=P10.B_READY`.
- Durable evidence:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m7l_p10a_entry_precheck_20260226T023945Z/`
- Planning/docs synchronized for `P10.A` closure across:
  - `platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md`,
  - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`,
  - `platform.build_plan.md`.

## 2026-02-26 02:47:57 +00:00 - Terminology hardening pass for recruiter-facing dev_min claim reports
- Objective:
  - remove repo-style and informal wording from claim narratives; keep language externally understandable and engineering-specific.
- Updated files:
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/managed_iac_state_locking_and_cost_guardrails.report.md`
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/auditable_release_pipeline_immutable_images.report.md`
- Key wording changes:
  - replaced informal closure wording (`green`, `false-green`, `get green faster`, `mostly green`) with explicit pass/compliance wording.
  - replaced `footgun`/`cost-footgun` wording with `high-cost default configuration/posture`.
  - replaced one shorthand narrative reference (`M2 closure`) with execution-id-first wording.
- Verification:
  - scanned active dev_min claim reports and confirmed no remaining `green`/`footgun` slang terms.

## 2026-02-26 03:08:00 +00:00 - Executed sequential P10.B -> P10.C -> P10.D (all green)
- Execution chain:
  - `m7m` from `m7l`,
  - `m7n` from `m7m`,
  - `m7o` from `m7n`.
- Results:
  - `P10.B`: run `22425642619`, exec `m7m_p10b_case_trigger_component_20260226T024750Z`, `next_gate=P10.C_READY`.
  - `P10.C`: run `22425663658`, exec `m7n_p10c_cm_component_20260226T024847Z`, `next_gate=P10.D_READY`.

- Blockers:
  - none triggered (`M7P10-B2/B3/B4/B7` clear).
- Evidence:
  - case-label component proofs emitted (`case_trigger/cm/ls`),
  - LS writer-boundary probe emitted (`ls_writer_boundary_probe_m7o_p10d_ls_component_20260226T024940Z.json`).
- Plan docs synchronized:
  - `platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md`,
  - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`,
  - `platform.build_plan.md`.

## 2026-02-26 03:09:00 +00:00 - Acronym expansion pass for recruiter-facing dev_min reports
- Objective:
  - expand acronyms to longform at first occurrence per document while preserving technical precision.
- Updated files:
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/auditable_release_pipeline_immutable_images.report.md`
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/secure_ci_oidc_and_least_privilege_registry_auth.report.md`
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/managed_iac_state_locking_and_cost_guardrails.report.md`
- Example expansions applied:
  - `continuous integration (CI)`, `OpenID Connect (OIDC)`, `Identity and Access Management (IAM)`,
  - `Elastic Container Registry (ECR)`, `application programming interface (API)`,
  - `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`, `network address translation (NAT)`, `load balancer (LB)`.
- Verification:

## 2026-02-26 03:01:17 +00:00 - Planned merged secrets + runtime-freshness claim report
- Updated claim planning document:
  - `docs/experience_lake/dev_min/claim_expansion_report_plan.md`
- Actions:
  - marked Claim C (managed IaC foundation and cost guardrails) as complete.
  - added Claim D as next active claim:
    - managed secret lifecycle and runtime credential freshness enforcement.
  - pinned claim scope, non-claims, and workflow state progression (Scope Lock complete; Draft Core next).
- Reasoning:
  - merged claim keeps security posture and runtime correctness in one auditable control chain and avoids partial, weaker storytelling.

## 2026-02-26 03:15:00 +00:00 - P10.E contract pinned before workflow lane wiring
- Problem:
  - `P10.E` had no executable managed lane despite `P10.B/C/D` being green, leaving `M7.I` open.
- Decision:
  - pin `P10.E` as a managed lane (`phase_mode=m7p`) in the existing workflow.
  - require upstream continuity from `P10.B/C/D` summaries + blocker registers.
  - require durable proof triplet (`case_trigger/cm/ls_component_proof.json`) before `ADVANCE_TO_M7`.
  - pin success gate to `phase_verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M7`, `next_gate=M7.J_READY`.
- Artifacts pinned:
  - `p10e_case_labels_rollup_matrix.json`
  - `p10e_case_labels_blocker_register.json`
  - `p10e_case_labels_verdict.json`
  - `p10e_execution_summary.json`
- Next action:
  - implement workflow lane `m7p`, dispatch with upstream ids (`m7m/m7n/m7o`), and close `P10` if green.

## 2026-02-26 03:18:00 +00:00 - Closed P10.E handle drift before workflow wiring
- Drift discovered:
  - `P10_ROLLUP_REQUIRED_PROOFS` and `M7_ROLLUP_READY_GATE` were referenced by the P10.E plan but not pinned in the registry.
- Remediation:
  - pinned both handles in `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` with explicit values.
- Rationale:
  - preserve fail-closed behavior and prevent hidden defaults during P10.E rollup execution.

## 2026-02-26 03:24:00 +00:00 - P10.E lane refined to avoid non-workflow commit dependency
- Issue:
  - first design referenced new registry keys, which would require a non-workflow push before execution.
- Decision:
  - keep `m7p` fail-closed but depend only on already-pinned handles + explicit hard checks for proof triplet and `M7.J_READY`.
- Outcome:
  - managed lane can execute without violating the workflow-only commit law.

## 2026-02-26 03:32:00 +00:00 - Implemented + executed `m7p` and closed P10.E
- Workflow implementation:
  - added `phase_mode=m7p` lane to `.github/workflows/dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`.
  - lane validates upstream `P10.B/C/D` summaries + blocker registers + proof triplet.
  - lane emits `p10e_*` artifacts and enforces fail-closed verdict gate.
- Commit/push:
  - commit: `67f8e6e4`
  - message: `ci: add managed m7p p10 rollup lane`
  - branch: `migrate-dev`
- Managed run:
  - run id: `22426064165`
  - execution id: `m7p_p10e_rollup_20260226T030607Z`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, `phase_verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M7`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.J_READY`.
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m7/_tmp_run_22426064165/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m7p_p10e_rollup_20260226T030607Z/`
- Planning updates:
  - `platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md` updated for P10.E closure.
  - `platform.M7.build_plan.md` updated (`M7.I` closed green).
  - `platform.build_plan.md` updated (case/label closure DoD now green; `M7.J` next).

## 2026-02-26 03:45:00 +00:00 - M7.J implementation strategy pinned before coding
- Gap:
  - M7 lacks an executable closure lane after `P10.E`; no deterministic `ADVANCE_TO_M8` artifact chain exists yet.
- Decision:
  - implement `phase_mode=m7q` in `dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`.
  - map upstream refs using existing inputs:
    - `upstream_m6d_execution` = `P8.E` execution id,
    - `upstream_m6g_execution` = `P9.E` execution id,
    - `upstream_m6h_execution` = `P10.E` execution id.
  - require upstream summary/blocker/verdict continuity before closure.
  - emit `m7_execution_summary.json`, `m8_handoff_pack.json`, and M7 cost-outcome receipts.
- Success contract:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M8`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M8_READY`.

## 2026-02-26 03:56:00 +00:00 - Implemented `m7q` managed lane for M7.J closure
- Workflow update:
  - `dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml` now includes `phase_mode=m7q`.
- Lane behavior:
  - validates upstream `P8.E/P9.E/P10.E` summaries + blocker registers + verdict/gate continuity.
  - validates budget/cost handles and captures AWS MTD spend.
  - emits `m7_*` closure artifacts and `m8_handoff_pack.json`.
  - enforces fail-closed verdict gate (`ADVANCE_TO_M8`, `M8_READY`).
- Next step:
  - commit/push workflow-only change and execute `m7q`.

## 2026-02-26 04:02:00 +00:00 - Executed `m7q` and closed M7
- Workflow run:
  - run id: `22426311129`
  - mode: `phase_mode=m7q`
  - execution id: `m7q_m7_rollup_sync_20260226T031710Z`.
- Upstream chain used:
  - `m7f_p8e_rollup_20260225T214307Z`
  - `m7k_p9e_rollup_20260226T023154Z`
  - `m7p_p10e_rollup_20260226T030607Z`.
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M8`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M8_READY`.
- Cost posture captured by lane:
  - `spend_amount=78.3708562065 USD` (below alert-3 `270 USD`).
- Artifacts emitted and durable:
  - `m7_execution_summary.json`, `m8_handoff_pack.json`, `m7_phase_budget_envelope.json`, `m7_phase_cost_outcome_receipt.json`.
- Planning status update:
  - `M7.J` closed green; `M7` marked functionally `DONE` with deferred throughput certification note (`M7-D18`).
