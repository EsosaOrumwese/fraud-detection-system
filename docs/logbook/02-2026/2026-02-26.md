## 2026-02-26 01:32:00 +00:00 - M7.P9.A plan/execution lane closure (`m7g`)
- Planned `P9.A` as explicit entry gate before `DF/AL/DLA` execution in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M7.build_plan.md`
- Implemented managed lane `phase_mode=m7g` in:
  - `.github/workflows/dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`
- Workflow-only commit (current branch `migrate-dev`):
  - `ci: add managed m7g p9a entry lane`
- Dispatched authoritative run:
  - workflow run `22423991265`
  - execution id `m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blocker_count=0`
  - `next_gate=M7.F_READY`
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m7/_gh_run_22423991265_artifacts/p9a-entry-precheck-20260226T013600Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z/`
- Decision outcome:
  - `M7.P9.A` is closed green; `M7.F` can proceed to `P9.B` (`DF` lane closure).

## 2026-02-26 01:45:00 +00:00 - Opened M7.P9.B/C/D sequential execution plan
- Confirmed current run-scoped ingest sample is low (`total_receipts=18`), so strict throughput assertion would produce false blocker posture.
- Chosen lane pattern:
  - `m7h` (`P9.B DF`) -> `m7i` (`P9.C AL`) -> `m7j` (`P9.D DLA`) with upstream gate chaining.
- Chosen proof surfaces:
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/df_component_proof.json`
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/al_component_proof.json`
  - `evidence/runs/{platform_run_id}/decision_lane/dla_component_proof.json`
- Chosen performance posture:
  - low-sample guarded throughput waiver (<200 sample),
  - lag/error/retry invariants still fail-closed.

## 2026-02-26 01:52:00 +00:00 - Implemented managed P9 component workflow lanes
- Updated `.github/workflows/dev_full_m6f_streaming_active.yml`:
  - added `phase_mode=m7h/m7i/m7j`,
  - added `run_m7hij_remote` job for `P9.B/P9.C/P9.D` sequential execution.
- Added lane outputs:
  - `p9b_df_*`, `p9c_al_*`, `p9d_dla_*` run-control artifacts,
  - decision-lane component proofs under `DECISION_LANE_EVIDENCE_PATH_PATTERN`.
- Added `DLA` append-only probe write/readback guard.
- Verified YAML syntax locally (`YAML_OK`).

## 2026-02-26 01:56:00 +00:00 - Started P9.B managed execution (`m7h`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7g_p9a_entry_precheck_20260226T013600Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `M7.G_READY`.
- Sequential lock: `P9.C` and `P9.D` remain blocked until `P9.B` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:52:00 +00:00 - P9.B (`m7h`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424352180`
- Execution id: `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.G_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - DF component proof published under decision-lane run prefix.
- Next: start `P9.C` (`m7i`) with upstream execution `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`.

## 2026-02-26 02:03:00 +00:00 - Started P9.C managed execution (`m7i`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7h_p9b_df_component_20260226T015122Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `M7.H_READY`.
- Sequential lock: `P9.D` remains blocked until `P9.C` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:54:00 +00:00 - P9.C (`m7i`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424410762`
- Execution id: `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M7.H_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - AL continuity and upstream proof chain checks passed,
  - `al_component_proof.json` published.
- Next: start `P9.D` (`m7j`) with upstream execution `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`.

## 2026-02-26 02:08:00 +00:00 - Started P9.D managed execution (`m7j`)
- Upstream pinned execution: `m7i_p9c_al_component_20260226T015350Z`.
- Expected gate on success: `P9.E_READY`.
- Sequential lock: no P9 rollup start until `P9.D` is green.

## 2026-02-26 01:56:00 +00:00 - P9.D (`m7j`) completed green
- Workflow run: `22424458740`
- Execution id: `m7j_p9d_dla_component_20260226T015553Z`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=P9.E_READY`
- Notes:
  - throughput assertion waived (sample <200 receipts),
  - upstream proof chain checks passed (`df` + `al` proofs),
  - append-only audit probe and `dla_component_proof.json` published.
- Outcome: `P9.B/P9.C/P9.D` component lanes are closed green; `P9.E` rollup is now the remaining P9 gate.

## 2026-02-26 02:12:00 +00:00 - Pinned non-waived throughput gate for P8/P9 production-readiness
- Added registry throughput-cert pins (including target `134,000,000 events/hour`, about `37,223 eps`).
- Marked current P8/P9 lane performance as provisional due `waived_low_sample` mode.
- Added fail-closed blockers:
  - `M7-B18` (M7 throughput cert missing/waived),
  - `M7P8-B8`,
  - `M7P9-B8`.
- Updated M7/P8/P9 plans so final production claim is blocked until non-waived throughput certification artifacts exist.

## 2026-02-26 02:29:00 +00:00 - Realigned throughput-cert gate to post-M7 (deferred, mandatory)
- Context:
  - user directed that throughput-cert should not block M7 functional wiring closure,
  - but it must remain mandatory for post-M7 non-soak production-scale validation.
- Actions:
  - patched `platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7P8-B8` -> `M7P8-D8` (deferred item),
    - updated P8 throughput section and exit-rule language.
  - patched `platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7P9-B8` -> `M7P9-D8` (deferred item),
    - updated P9 throughput section and exit-rule language.
  - patched `platform.M7.build_plan.md`:
    - `M7-B18` -> `M7-D18` (deferred item),
    - removed active M7-blocking semantics for throughput-cert,
    - updated M7.H tasks/DoD/planning notes.
  - patched `platform.build_plan.md`:
    - M7 caveat now states post-M7 mandatory throughput-cert,
    - removed non-waived throughput line from M7 DoD anchors.
- Outcome:
  - M7 remains focused on functional closure,
  - production-scale throughput claim remains blocked until post-M7 non-soak certification is executed.
