# Logbook
### Date: 3rd February 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 05:13AM
  - Read control & ingress context and authority docs (platform blueprint + deployment notes, engine interface pack, platform narratives, SR/IG/EB/WSP/Oracle Store design-authority, and current impl_actual maps) to prepare for green-ness testing of Control & Ingress.
  - Repo scan completed for situational awareness (rg --files).

* 05:32AM
  - Local parity run executed for Control & Ingress: started parity stack, confirmed LocalStack Kinesis + MinIO health, reset Kinesis streams to clean slate.
  - Generated platform run id platform_20260201T224449Z and wrote runs/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID; started IG and confirmed health endpoint responding (AMBER with BUS_HEALTH_UNKNOWN before traffic).
  - Ran SR READY publish (run_id=5454caf736a7e8febe7535d6fbf95650) and WSP READY consumer with WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=200, WSP_OUTPUT_CONCURRENCY=4; WSP logs show concurrent stream starts and 200 emitted per output.
  - Verified EB flow via IG: admitted counts per topic = traffic.fraud 194, arrival_events 191, arrival_entities 193, flow_anchor.fraud 196; deficits map 1:1 to IG duplicate detections (6/9/7/4 respectively). Kinesis counts match IG admitted counts.

* 06:09PM
  - Added RTDL pre-design gating questions to Phase 4 of platform.build_plan.md and recorded plan/completion in platform.impl_actual.
