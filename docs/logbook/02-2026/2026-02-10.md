### Date: 10th February 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 03:32AM
  - Added a platform implementation-note entry documenting:
    - the accepted successful full-platform run (`platform_20260209T231403Z`) with evidence paths,
    - the current implemented live-stream flow narrative across meta-layer, C&I, RTDL core, decision lane, case/label lane, and obs/gov lane.
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 03:33AM
  - Updated local parity runbook to reflect current implemented services and runtime posture:
    - added case bus stream (`fp.bus.case.v1`) to preconditions/bootstrap expectations,
    - added `platform-operate-obs-gov-up` to explicit startup commands,
    - added obs/gov pack file to pack inventory,
    - added obs/gov scope note under orchestration,
    - documented reporter concurrency caveat (`platform-run-report` vs reporter worker),
    - added explicit `20 -> 200` full-stream gate pattern with evidence paths.
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md`.

* 03:34AM
  - Normalized timestamp heading style in `docs/logbook/02-2026/2026-02-09.md` to the project’s standard bullet-time format (`* HH:MMPM`) for consistency with existing logbook conventions.

* 03:56AM
  - Started parity stack realignment sweep before Learning/Evolution handoff.
  - Recorded detailed pre-implementation decision entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Scope locked for this sweep:
    - align DL/DF/AL/DLA + CaseTrigger/CaseMgmt/LabelStore onto local-parity Postgres posture,
    - remove/avoid shared-table collision risk (`checkpoint_tokens`) between DF and CaseTrigger,
    - update packs/env/runbook and then re-validate via 20/200 full-platform runs.

* 04:19AM
  - Diagnosed current parity-run blocker (`platform_20260210T040009Z`):
    - `local_parity_rtdl_decision_lane_v0` had `dla_worker` down,
    - DLA crash traced to Postgres placeholder contract mismatch in `decision_log_audit/storage.py` (`psycopg` execute path).
  - Appended detailed decision+remediation entry to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Locked next actions:
    - patch DLA Postgres SQL placeholder rendering,
    - rerun 20-event then 200-event parity gates after tests.

* 04:25AM
  - Diagnosed second parity blocker after DLA fix:
    - `wsp_ready_consumer` was starved by Kinesis head-page replay (`TRIM_HORIZON` + single-page read per poll), so new READY never got consumed.
  - Added detailed root-cause/remediation entry to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Next action locked:
    - patch `world_streamer_producer/control_bus.py` iterator semantics and add regression tests before rerunning parity gates.

* 04:33AM
  - Identified active-run starvation despite IG publish activity:
    - RTDL consumers in local parity were reading from `trim_horizon`, replaying deep historical backlog.
    - This delayed/blocked current-run decision progression and amplified CSFB `LATE_CONTEXT_EVENT` churn.
  - Recorded full diagnosis and remediation decision in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Next action:
    - switch local-parity consumer start positions to `latest` for active-run validation workers, then rerun 20-event gate.
* 04:42AM
  - Opened stack-conformance closure sweep before Learning/Evolution handoff.
  - Appended detailed pre-implementation decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked fixes for this sweep:
    - Postgres SQL placeholder contract in AL storage,
    - Postgres SQL placeholder contract in CaseTrigger storage,
    - WSP governance append-conflict handling so READY consumer does not crash,
    - then 20/200 full-platform parity reruns for green confirmation.
* 04:44AM
  - Implemented code fixes:
    - `src/fraud_detection/action_layer/storage.py` Postgres placeholder contract/param ordering hardening.
    - `src/fraud_detection/case_trigger/storage.py` Postgres placeholder contract/param ordering hardening.
    - `src/fraud_detection/world_streamer_producer/ready_consumer.py` non-fatal handling for governance `S3_APPEND_CONFLICT`.
  - Added regression tests in:
    - `tests/services/action_layer/test_phase1_storage.py`
    - `tests/services/case_trigger/test_phase4_publish.py`
    - `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py`
  - Executed targeted pytest suites; all green:
    - action_layer phase1 storage (4 passed)
    - case_trigger phase4 publish (9 passed)
    - WSP ready consumer + control bus reader (9 passed)
* 05:12AM
  - Detected and escalated material runtime drift during stack-alignment validation:
    - `case_mgmt_worker` was down in parity status while other packs were healthy.
    - Crash signature: Postgres placeholder contract mismatch in CaseMgmt (`0 placeholders but 1 parameter`).
  - Added detailed pre-implementation decision entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked remediation sweep:
    - align CaseMgmt + LabelStore SQL helper renderers to psycopg placeholder contract used by AL/CaseTrigger/DLA fixes,
    - then run targeted tests plus fresh 20/200 parity validation.
* 05:35AM
  - Completed CaseMgmt/LabelStore Postgres placeholder sweep and Postgres optional-query rollback fix.
  - Added/ran regressions:
    - `tests/services/case_mgmt/test_phase7_observability.py` (`5 passed`)
    - `tests/services/case_mgmt` (`45 passed`)
    - `tests/services/label_store` (`40 passed`)
  - Re-ran monitored parity gates:
    - 20-event run: `platform_20260210T052406Z` (green)
    - 200-event run: `platform_20260210T052919Z` (full 200 completion on all outputs; green)
  - Updated implementation evidence in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
* 06:10AM
  - Found run/operate evidence-selection drift:
    - make targets (`platform-run-report`, `platform-governance-query`, `platform-env-conformance`, `platform-evidence-ref-resolve`) preferred stale shell `PLATFORM_RUN_ID` over `ACTIVE_RUN_ID`.
    - this can write conformance/report artifacts to wrong run scope.
  - Added detailed decision entry and locked remediation in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
* 06:15AM
  - Implemented run-id selection hardening in `makefile`:
    - targets updated: `platform-run-report`, `platform-governance-query`, `platform-env-conformance`, `platform-evidence-ref-resolve`.
    - resolution order now: `ACTIVE_RUN_ID` first, then `PLATFORM_RUN_ID` fallback.
  - Validated fix:
    - `make platform-env-conformance` now writes to active run path `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T052919Z/obs/environment_conformance.json` despite stale shell `PLATFORM_RUN_ID`.
    - `make platform-run-report` now writes to `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T052919Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`.
* 06:16AM
  - Detected runtime substrate drift while validating (LocalStack Kinesis internal backend errors caused worker exits).
  - Remediated by recycling parity substrate and orchestration:
    - `make platform-parity-stack-down`
    - `make platform-parity-stack-up`
    - `make platform-parity-bootstrap`
    - `make platform-operate-parity-restart`
  - Final liveness check:
    - `make platform-operate-parity-status` -> all implemented packs/services running and ready for active run `platform_20260210T052919Z`.
  - Recorded detailed closure evidence in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
* 06:17AM
  - Updated platform build-plan rolling status to match closure posture:
    - Phase 5 marked complete with live integration evidence tied to `platform_20260210T052919Z`.
    - next active phase updated to Phase 6 (Learning & Registry plane).
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md`
* 08:15AM
  - Added a new pre-Phase-6 cross-cutting efficiency gate to platform planning:
    - created `Phase 5.10` in `platform.build_plan.md` focused on `WSP -> IG -> EB` hot-path hardening under run/operate + obs/gov measurement surfaces,
    - pinned explicit local-parity budgets (`20` and `200` wall-clock, IG admission/publish p95, WSP retry pressure),
    - made Phase 6 start conditional on Phase 5.10 PASS (or explicit user-approved risk acceptance).
  - Recorded full decision trail (trigger, alternatives, rationale, planned controls, and outcome) in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md`
* 08:24AM
  - Started Phase `5.10` implementation on the shared hot path (`WSP -> IG -> EB`).
  - Logged pre-change plan in platform implementation map with bottleneck diagnosis and selected patch scope:
    - IG Postgres connection churn reduction,
    - IG payload-schema cache to remove per-event schema reload overhead,
    - threaded IG service runtime posture for parity daemon mode,
    - parity default WSP output concurrency cap.
  - Next validation locked:
    - targeted tests, then `20`-event full-pack run, then `200`-event run against new budgets.
* 08:25AM
  - Opened a Phase 5.10 drift-closure planning thread for runtime stops in local parity (`csfb_intake`, `dla_worker`).
  - Root cause isolated to shared Kinesis reader error propagation under LocalStack transient/stale-sequence conditions.
  - Appended detailed pre-change decision entry (alternatives + selected approach + validation plan) to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked implementation direction:
    - harden `src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kinesis.py` (transient error tolerance + stale checkpoint fallback),
    - add focused event-bus resilience tests,
    - rerun 20 then 200 full-platform parity gates.
* 08:35AM
  - Implemented Phase 5.10 runtime drift closure in shared Kinesis consumer path:
    - hardened `src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kinesis.py` for transient `list_shards/get_shard_iterator/get_records` failures,
    - added stale-sequence fallback + suppression cache to prevent repeated checkpoint-reset storms,
    - kept workers alive under LocalStack sequence/backend instability.
  - Added resilience regression suite:
    - `tests/services/event_bus/test_kinesis_reader_resilience.py`.
  - Validation executed (all green):
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/event_bus/test_kinesis_reader_resilience.py tests/services/online_feature_plane/test_phase2_kinesis_start_position.py -q --import-mode=importlib` (`5 passed`)
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/event_bus -q --import-mode=importlib` (`8 passed, 1 skipped`)
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/context_store_flow_binding/test_phase3_intake.py -q --import-mode=importlib` (`4 passed`)
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase3_intake.py -q --import-mode=importlib` (`10 passed`)
  - Full parity gate reruns (strict 20 -> 200) after patch:
    - `platform_20260210T082746Z` (`20` per output; `emitted=80`; `10.703694s`; all packs/services running-ready)
    - `platform_20260210T083021Z` (`200` per output; `emitted=800`; `85.823407s`; all packs/services running-ready)
  - Obs/Gov evidence for 200 run:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T083021Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T083021Z/obs/environment_conformance.json` (`PASS`)
  - Phase 5.10 budget snapshot (run-scoped):
    - 20 wall-clock PASS (`10.70s <= 300s`)
    - 200 wall-clock PASS (`85.82s <= 1200s`)
    - IG admission p95 PASS (`max sampled p95 1.449s <= 8s`)
    - IG publish p95 PASS (`max sampled p95 0.163s <= 5s`)
    - WSP retry PASS (`retry_total=0`, `retry_exhausted=0`).
* 08:56AM
  - Opened P0 implementation kickoff for platform-wide Postgres connection churn collapse (post-200 run drift).
  - Added detailed pre-change decision entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked concrete fix scope:
    - add shared thread-local Postgres runtime connector with reconnect + rollback-on-error context semantics,
    - migrate live-pack adapter `_connect()`/probe callsites away from per-operation `psycopg.connect(...)`,
    - validate with targeted tests and strict `20 -> 200` full-platform parity reruns plus post-stream liveness check.
* 08:59AM
  - Implemented P0 connector migration step:
    - added `src/fraud_detection/postgres_runtime.py` (thread-local postgres connector + retry + rollback-on-error).
    - migrated live-pack Postgres adapters from direct `psycopg.connect(...)` to shared runtime connector across RTDL core, decision lane, and case/label plane services.
    - patched parity/reporting Postgres callsites used during full-run evidence generation.
  - Left `src/fraud_detection/ingestion_gate/pg_index.py` unchanged because it already uses thread-local persistent Postgres connections.
  - Ran syntax validation:
    - `python -m py_compile` on all modified Python files (`PASS`).
  - Next: targeted pytest + parity liveness + strict `20 -> 200` rerun.
* 09:12AM
  - Found corrective defect in first connector rollout:
    - persistent postgres connections were left open in transaction for successful read scopes (`idle in transaction` buildup) and blocked IG migration locks.
  - Patched `src/fraud_detection/postgres_runtime.py` to mirror psycopg context semantics:
    - commit on successful scope exit (when not autocommit),
    - rollback on exception,
    - drop cached connection on commit/rollback failure.
  - Updated postgres-routing tests for new connector entrypoint:
    - `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase7_checkpoints.py`
    - `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase7_replay.py`
    - `tests/services/case_trigger/test_phase5_checkpoints.py`
  - Focused validation:
    - `30 passed` across decision_fabric/case_trigger/action_layer/DLA/CSFB targeted suites.
* 09:16AM
  - Hit environment constraint during broad rerun: drive `C:` ran out of space (`OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`).
  - Performed minimal transient cleanup only:
    - removed `.pytest_cache`,
    - pruned older `runs/fraud-platform/platform_*` run directories outside current date scope,
    - truncated `runs/fraud-platform/operate/*/logs/*.log` for active debugging window.
  - Did not touch engine datasets under `runs/local_full_run-5` or domain artifact trees under `artefacts/*`.
* 09:27AM
  - Executed strict runtime gate after fixes on fresh run id:
    - `make platform-run-new` -> `platform_20260210T091951Z`
    - restarted all run/operate packs against new active run.
  - 20-event gate (`WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=20`, `WSP_READY_MAX_MESSAGES=1`):
    - SR READY: `scenario_run_id=942a906c0fe7414bbe0fdc26f32f4a74`
    - WSP session: start `09:21:46.780111Z`, complete `09:22:00.188588Z`, emitted `80`.
    - all four outputs stopped at `emitted=20`.
  - 200-event gate (`WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=200`, `WSP_READY_MAX_MESSAGES=1`):
    - SR READY: `scenario_run_id=74bd83db1ad3d1fa136e579115d55429`
    - WSP session: start `09:24:36.354654Z`, complete `09:25:55.947318Z`, emitted `800`.
    - all four outputs stopped at `emitted=200`.
  - Post-stream liveness (immediate + idle hold) stayed full green across:
    - control_ingress, rtdl_core, rtdl_decision_lane, case_labels, obs_gov packs.
  - Obs/Gov evidence produced for this run:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T091951Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T091951Z/obs/environment_conformance.json` (`PASS`).
* 10:11AM
  - Per user request, paused storage-size investigation and executed a strict Phase 5.10 closure verification pass.
  - Confirmed from run evidence that post-fix run `platform_20260210T091951Z` still satisfies 5.10 gate posture:
    - 20-event and 200-event bounded streams completed (`emitted=80`, `emitted=800`),
    - all four output lanes reached `emitted=20` and `emitted=200` stop boundaries,
    - run/operate packs remained all-green.
  - Updated build-plan closure wording to include post-fix reconfirmation run:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Appended a dedicated go/no-go checkpoint entry:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Outcome: Phase 5.10 remains closed; Phase 6 (Learning & Registry) is unblocked.
* 10:21AM
  - Opened and completed planning update for next-plane execution readiness:
    - expanded platform Phase 6 from a coarse DoD block into sectioned gates `6.1..6.8`,
    - explicitly embedded run/operate and obs/gov meta-layer onboarding as closure gates (`6.6`, `6.7`),
    - rewrote Phase 7 to efficiency-first sequencing with a blocking capacity gate (`7.1`) ahead of broader P1 hardening.
  - Updated files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planning outcome:
    - next active gate is now explicit: `Phase 6.1` (contracts + ownership lock for Learning/Registry),
    - Phase 7 now requires measured throughput/capacity proof (including large-run projection posture) before wider hardening.
* 10:31AM
  - Added an explicit blocking `Phase 6.0` archive readiness gate to platform planning so Learning execution cannot start on implied archive assumptions.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - inserted `Phase 6.0 — Archive readiness gate (blocking precondition)` with concrete DoD for:
      - archive writer corridor contract,
      - immutable archive provenance fields (`origin_offset`, `ContextPins`, payload digest),
      - fail-closed EB/archive mismatch posture,
      - run/operate + obs/gov archive visibility.
    - switched rolling status active gate from `6.1` to `6.0`.
  - Recorded full pre-change and applied decision entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 10:37AM
  - Opened implementation execution for Phase `6.0` and `6.1` (user-directed).
  - Recorded detailed pre-change execution lock in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Created component implementation map for new archive component:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/archive_writer.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked implementation scope:
    - new `archive_writer` runtime corridor with immutable archive writes + replay-basis mismatch anomaly posture,
    - run/operate + obs/gov onboarding for archive readiness evidence,
    - authoritative learning/registry contract schemas + typed validators for Phase `6.1`.
* 10:54AM
  - Closed implementation pass for Phase `6.0` (Archive readiness gate) and Phase `6.1` (Learning/Registry contracts + ownership lock).
  - Applied runtime and contract artifacts:
    - `src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/*`
    - `config/platform/archive_writer/*`
    - `src/fraud_detection/learning_registry/*`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/archive/*`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/learning_registry/*`
    - `config/platform/learning_registry/ownership_boundaries_v0.yaml`
    - run/operate onboarding: `config/platform/run_operate/packs/local_parity_rtdl_core.v0.yaml`
    - profile/wiring updates: `config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml`, `makefile`, `.env.platform.local`
  - Captured implementation closure entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/archive_writer.impl_actual.md`
  - Validation executed:
    - `python -m py_compile src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/contracts.py src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/store.py src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/observability.py src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/reconciliation.py src/fraud_detection/archive_writer/worker.py src/fraud_detection/learning_registry/schemas.py src/fraud_detection/learning_registry/contracts.py src/fraud_detection/platform_reporter/run_reporter.py` (`PASS`)
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/archive_writer tests/services/learning_registry/test_phase61_contracts.py tests/services/platform_reporter/test_run_reporter.py -q --import-mode=importlib` (`10 passed`)
* 10:55AM
  - Captured operational reporter snapshot to anchor obs/gov evidence for this closure:
    - command: `make platform-run-report`
    - artifact: `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260210T091951Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`
    - output includes:
      - top-level `archive` section,
      - `archive_writer_reconciliation.json` in component reconciliation refs,
      - archive health `GREEN`.
  - Noted caveat for future integration gate:
    - archive counters are zero in this snapshot because no fresh stream pass ran after archive writer onboarding on run `platform_20260210T091951Z`; non-zero archive throughput proof will be captured in upcoming strict stream gate runs.
* 11:18AM

    - `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/platform_blueprint_notes_v0.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/component-specific/world_streamer_producer.design-authority.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/deployment_tooling_notes_v0.md`
    - full `docs/model_spec/data-engine/interface_pack/*` boundary contracts (README/interface/catalogue/gates/storage/contracts)
    - platform narratives (`control_and_ingress`, `real-time_decision_loop`, `label_and_case`, `learning_and_evolution`, `observability_and_governance`)
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/component-specific/flow-narrative-platform-design.md`
    - implementation maps/status (`platform.build_plan.md`, `platform.impl_actual.md`) and relevant component authorities (`scenario_runner`, `oracle_store`, `ingestion_gate`, `event_bus`).
  - Repo-wide scan completed (`README.md`, top-level tree, file-count inventory) to align docs with current implementation footprint.
  - No code/runtime changes applied in this pass; intent was context locking for next local -> dev planning track.
* 7:16PM
  - Opened pre-change lock for implementation-map restructure requested by USER.
  - Planned restructure:
    - create `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/` for current baseline files,
    - create `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/` for active promotion track,
    - update `AGENTS.md` routing/paths to dev_substrate,
    - append routing entries for continuity.
  - No destructive history rewrite planned; append-only posture preserved.
* 7:26PM
  - Applied implementation-map track split requested by USER.
  - Created:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/`
  - Moved existing implementation-map files (39 files) into `local_parity/` baseline.
  - Added active-track starters:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
  - Replaced root map README with routing index:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/README.md`
  - Updated baseline README:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/README.md`
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` routing so active implementation-map writes go to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/*.md`
    and baseline references resolve under:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/*.md`
  - Added routing continuity entry to baseline platform impl map:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Validation: directory/file inventory checks only (no runtime/test impact expected).
* 9:03PM
  - Reviewed authority document requested by USER:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`
  - Outcome:
    - authority is aligned with active dev-substrate direction (`same laws, different wiring`, managed Kafka + AWS S3 evidence posture, budget-safe demo -> destroy),
    - no semantic drift detected versus current platform rails.
  - Appended review checkpoint to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Follow-up flagged:
    - pin one canonical Terraform env naming scheme (`core/demo` vs `dev_min_core/dev_min_demo`) before Terraform lane unlock.
* 9:06PM
  - USER confirmed separate topology draft was removed.
  - Applied corrective routing decision:
    - dev-substrate track will use pinned authority doc directly for placement/structure:
      - `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`
    - topology/placement decisions continue as append-only entries in:
      - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Added corrective entry to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
* 5:04PM
  - Opened pre-change lock to close remaining holes in `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`.
  - Planned closures: explicit normative file paths + precedence, pinned `dev_min` profile artifact, Step Functions consistency cleanup, and budget hard-stop decision closure.
* 9:37PM
  - Opened corrective closure lock for `dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md` after verification sweep.
  - Residual holes pinned for closure:
    - bad normative file path in Section 0.5 (`control_and_ingress` filename variant mismatch),
    - Section 17 still framed as "Open Decisions" despite status claiming full closure,
    - pinned evidence schema contract paths absent in repo,
    - pinned `config/platform/profiles/dev_min.yaml` absent in repo.
  - Planned fix posture:
    - patch authority wording/paths,
    - create `dev_min` profile artifact,
    - create `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/dev_min` schema surface,
    - re-verify no unresolved closure wording remains.
  - Drift checkpoint: no semantic/runtime behavior change; authority-contract closure only.
* 9:39PM
  - Routing correction applied for implementation-map continuity:
    - migrated closure-pass trail to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`,
    - removed accidental legacy file `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` to avoid dual-authority drift.
  - No behavioral/runtime change; documentation routing hygiene only.
* 9:40PM
  - Closed remaining holes in `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`.
  - Applied consistency fixes:
    - corrected Section 0.5 normative path for `control_and_ingress.pre-design_decision.md`,
    - reframed Section 17 as pinned decision registry (not open-items framing),
    - repinned evidence schemas to `.schema.yaml` paths.
  - Created pinned artifact surfaces:
    - `config/platform/profiles/dev_min.yaml`,
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/dev_min/{README.md + 5 schema files}`.
  - Updated indexes:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/README.md`,
    - `config/platform/profiles/README.md`.
  - Validation:
    - grep sweep for residual open-item wording + path refs,
    - YAML parse check on all new files (`PASS`).
  - Drift checkpoint: no runtime semantic-law changes; documentation/contract closure only.
* 9:52PM
  - Rewrote active dev-substrate plan at `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` from coarse placeholder to full wave-based migration program.
  - Added explicit phases with DoD gates:
    - Phase 0 semantic freeze,
    - Phase 1 accounts/credentials bootstrap,
    - Phase 2 Terraform landing zone,
    - Phase 3-6 service-wave migrations,
    - Phase 7 meta-layer saturation,
    - Phase 8 integrated validation + cutover readiness.
  - Added deferred backlog section and strict no-phase-advance rule until DoD closure is recorded.
  - Validation: phase/DoD presence sweep passed.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning/documentation change only.
* 9:54PM
  - Opened Phase 0 implementation lock for dev-substrate migration plan.
  - DoD targets pinned:
    1) baseline snapshot,
    2) service-wave migration matrix,
    3) acceptance gate templates.
  - Baseline evidence anchors selected from local-parity closure records:
    - `platform_20260210T082746Z` (20-event),
    - `platform_20260210T083021Z` (200-event),
    - `platform_20260210T091951Z` (post-fix reconfirmation).
  - Planned artifact files under `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/` and Phase 0 checklist closure in active build plan.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning-only, no runtime behavior changes.
* 9:56PM
  - Implemented and closed dev-substrate Phase 0 (`mobilization + semantic freeze`).
  - Added new artifacts:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/phase0_baseline_snapshot.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/phase0_service_wave_matrix.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/phase0_acceptance_gate_templates.md`
  - Updated active build plan Phase 0 DoD to complete with evidence links:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Baseline anchored to accepted local-parity runs:
    - `platform_20260210T082746Z` (20-event),
    - `platform_20260210T083021Z` (200-event),
    - `platform_20260210T091951Z` (post-fix reconfirmation).
  - Drift checkpoint: planning/control closure only; no runtime behavior change.
* 10:05PM
  - Opened corrective Phase 0 simplification lock per USER direction.
  - Action scope:
    - remove Phase 0 auxiliary docs under `dev_substrate/`,
    - refactor Phase 0 in active build plan to reference only pre-design authority docs + local-parity implementation notes.
  - Rationale captured: avoid distracting/duplicative docs and avoid misleading cross-env comparison framing.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning-document simplification only; no runtime behavior changes.
* 10:06PM
  - Applied USER-directed Phase 0 simplification.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` so Phase 0 references only:
    - migration pre-design authority,
    - run/operate + obs/gov pre-design decisions,
    - local-parity platform implementation maps,
    - local-parity runbook.
  - Removed auxiliary Phase 0 docs from `dev_substrate/`:
    - `phase0_baseline_snapshot.md`,
    - `phase0_service_wave_matrix.md`,
    - `phase0_acceptance_gate_templates.md`.
  - Rationale logged: reduce distraction/duplication and avoid invalid cross-env performance comparison framing.
  - Drift checkpoint: documentation-only correction; no runtime behavior change.
* 10:08PM
  - Opened cleanup lock to remove `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/dev_min/` auxiliary schemas.
  - Planned corrective repin:
    - migration authority evidence contract section will point to existing platform contract families (IG receipts, RTDL audit/offset basis, archive records, dataset manifest),
    - `contracts/README.md` dev_min section will be removed,
    - active dev-substrate build-plan schema reference will be updated to existing contract families + reporter artifacts.
  - Drift checkpoint: documentation/authority simplification only; no runtime behavior changes.
* 10:09PM
  - Applied USER-approved cleanup to remove dev_min auxiliary contract family.
  - Deleted tracked files under `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/dev_min/`.
  - Repinned migration authority Section 17.2(7) to existing platform contract families (IG receipt, RTDL audit + offset basis, archive record, dataset manifest) and operational run summaries (`platform_run_report.json`, `environment_conformance.json`).
  - Removed dev_min contract section from `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/README.md`.
  - Updated dev-substrate build-plan Phase 7 evidence-conformance wording to use existing contracts + reporter outputs.
  - Validation: no active `contracts/dev_min` references remain outside historical append-only notes.
  - Drift checkpoint: documentation/authority simplification only; no runtime behavior changes.
* 10:12PM
  - Opened Phase 1 expansion lock in active dev-substrate build plan.
  - Planned update scope:
    - replace coarse Phase 1 bullets with explicit execution sections (tenancy, IAM, secrets, preflight, security hygiene, failure drills) and tightened DoD evidence checks.
  - User constraints applied:
    - no auxiliary docs,
    - no cross-env performance comparison framing,
    - authority-first references only.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning expansion only; no runtime behavior changes.
* 10:13PM
  - Expanded Phase 1 in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` to execution-ready detail.
  - Added explicit Phase 1 sections:
    - 1.A account/tenancy,
    - 1.B principal/permissions,
    - 1.C secret taxonomy/source of truth,
    - 1.D bootstrap + preflight gate,
    - 1.E security hygiene/leak prevention,
    - 1.F failure/recovery drills.
  - Tightened Phase 1 DoD to 8 auditable closure checks.
  - No new auxiliary docs created; expansion is in-place per USER direction.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning expansion only; no runtime behavior change.
* 10:15PM
  - Opened Phase 1 implementation lock (sections 1.A through 1.F).
  - Execution plan pinned:
    - discover AWS/Confluent context,
    - implement reproducible preflight path,
    - run positive + negative drills,
    - update Phase 1 DoD with evidence.
  - Security posture pinned: no secret values in logs/notes; only handles/names and pass/fail states.
  - Drift checkpoint: readiness/control implementation only; no semantic-law changes.
* 10:22PM
  - Implemented Phase 1 (`1.A -> 1.F`) execution tooling and status updates.
  - Added scripts:
    - `scripts/dev_substrate/phase1_preflight.ps1`
    - `scripts/dev_substrate/phase1_seed_ssm.ps1`
  - Added Make targets:
    - `platform-dev-min-phase1-preflight`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase1-seed-ssm`
    - with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` to preserve SSM path semantics under Git-Bash Make.
  - Expanded Phase 1 section and DoD status in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
  - Runtime evidence:
    - AWS identity confirmed (`account=230372904534`, `principal=arn:aws:iam::230372904534:user/fraud-dev`, `region=eu-west-2`).
    - strict preflight fails closed on missing `/fraud-platform/dev_min/confluent/*` handles (expected blocker).
    - permissive preflight passes with warnings (`DEV_MIN_ALLOW_MISSING_CONFLUENT_HANDLES=1`, `DEV_MIN_SKIP_CONFLUENT_API_PROBE=1`).
    - failure drills executed:
      - invalid AWS profile -> fail-closed,
      - invalid Confluent credentials on isolated drill prefix -> fail-closed,
      - seed helper without values -> explicit failure.
    - drill SSM handles cleaned (`/fraud-platform/dev_min_drill/confluent/*`).
  - Current Phase 1 posture: in progress pending real Confluent handle provisioning and strict preflight PASS.
  - Drift checkpoint: readiness controls only; no platform semantic/runtime flow changes.
* 10:49PM
  - Phase 1 strict closure is blocked by missing visible Kafka secret inputs in active shell/context:
    - `DEV_MIN_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP`,
    - `DEV_MIN_KAFKA_API_KEY`,
    - `DEV_MIN_KAFKA_API_SECRET`.
  - Evidence:
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase1-seed-ssm` fails with required-value error,
    - strict preflight fail-closed on missing `/fraud-platform/dev_min/confluent/*` handles.
  - Verified `.env.platform.local`/`.env.local` currently contain no `DEV_MIN|CONFLUENT|KAFKA` key names.
  - Unblock path logged:
    1) provide `DEV_MIN_KAFKA_*` values in active execution context,
    2) run `make platform-dev-min-phase1-seed-ssm`,
    3) run strict `make platform-dev-min-phase1-preflight`.
  - Drift checkpoint: fail-closed behavior working as intended; no semantic/runtime drift.
* 10:54PM
  - Opened Phase 1 env-surface correction lock to adopt dedicated `.env.dev_min`.
  - Planned changes:
    - source dedicated env file in dev-min preflight/seed Make targets,
    - add `.env.dev_min.example` template,
    - ignore `.env.dev_min` in git,
    - update Phase 1 build-plan text to pin dedicated env surface.
  - Validation plan includes safe drill using isolated SSM prefix and cleanup.
  - Drift checkpoint: execution-hygiene change only; no semantic/runtime flow changes.
* 10:58PM
  - Applied dedicated Phase 1 env-surface correction.
  - Implemented in `Makefile`:
    - added `DEV_MIN_ENV_FILE ?= .env.dev_min`,
    - `platform-dev-min-phase1-seed-ssm` and `platform-dev-min-phase1-preflight` now require + source `DEV_MIN_ENV_FILE` before invoking scripts.
  - Added `.env.dev_min.example` (placeholders only) and ignored `.env.dev_min` in `.gitignore`.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` to pin dedicated env surface and `DEV_MIN_ENV_FILE` override.
  - Validation drill (isolated prefix `/fraud-platform/dev_min_envfile_drill`):
    - seed via env file: PASS (handles written),
    - preflight via env file: PASS with expected `confluent_api_probe` WARN (skipped by flag),
    - cleanup completed (`aws ssm delete-parameters` on drill handles; temporary `.tmp` files removed).
  - Drift checkpoint: no semantic/runtime flow change; operator bootstrap hygiene only.
* 11:03PM
  - Executed strict Phase 1 closure attempt after USER updated `.env.dev_min`.
  - Commands:
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase1-seed-ssm` -> PASS (wrote `/fraud-platform/dev_min/confluent/bootstrap`, `/api_key`, `/api_secret`).
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase1-preflight` -> `FAIL_CLOSED`.
  - Strict preflight result details:
    - PASS: AWS CLI, Terraform, identity, region, SSM handles, S3 bucket read, secret hygiene.
    - FAIL: `confluent_api_probe` (Confluent API auth check failed).
  - Posture:
    - Phase 1 closure remains blocked only on Confluent key validity/scope.
    - Fail-closed behavior confirmed correct.
  - Drift checkpoint: no platform-flow drift; credential/auth blocker only.
* 11:03PM
  - Ran sanitized Confluent auth diagnostics to refine the blocker.
  - Probe result against `https://api.confluent.cloud/iam/v2/api-keys` using SSM-seeded credentials:
    - HTTP `401` (unauthorized).
  - Sanitized credential-shape checks from SSM:
    - `api_key len=16, quoted=False`,
    - `api_secret len=64, quoted=False`.
  - Conclusion:
    - not a missing-handle or obvious quote-format issue,
    - likely invalid/non-matching (or revoked) Confluent key/secret pair.
  - Drift checkpoint: no semantic/runtime flow change; diagnostic-only action.
* 11:09PM
  - Opened corrective drift-fix lock for Phase 1 preflight Confluent probe.
  - Reason:
    - current strict failure is tied to Confluent Cloud IAM endpoint probing,
    - this can diverge from Kafka-plane readiness and produce false-negative gates.
  - Planned correction:
    - move strict gate probe to Kafka-plane readiness (bootstrap + secret material + network reachability),
    - update Phase 1 plan wording to match actual intended gate semantics,
    - rerun strict preflight and record sanitized evidence.
  - Drift checkpoint: corrective alignment to design intent; no component-runtime graph change.
* 11:11PM
  - Applied corrective drift fix in `scripts/dev_substrate/phase1_preflight.ps1`.
  - Replaced Confluent IAM list-keys dependency with Kafka-plane readiness probe:
    - secret material resolve + sanity checks,
    - quoted-value guard,
    - bootstrap parse + DNS resolution + TCP reachability.
  - Updated build-plan wording and Phase 1 status:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
  - Strict validation rerun:
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase1-preflight` -> `PASS`.
    - `confluent_kafka_probe` PASS (`pkc-41wq6.eu-west-2.aws.confluent.cloud:9092` reachable).
  - Phase 1 posture:
    - **closed** (strict preflight PASS on canonical `dev_min` handles).
  - Drift checkpoint: mismatch corrected; no platform graph/ownership changes.
* 11:14PM
  - Added binding budget-control discipline to active dev-substrate build plan:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - section: `Budget Sentinel (binding for all dev_substrate phases)`.
  - New mandatory operator posture pinned:
    - pre-action paid-surface declaration,
    - post-action explicit `KEEP ON` vs `TURN OFF NOW`,
    - immediate teardown when USER is away/no-work,
    - no unattended paid ephemeral resources without explicit approval,
    - cost actions logged in logbook + impl notes.
  - Rationale:
    - enforce budget discipline as a first-class migration control, not an optional reminder.
  - Drift checkpoint: process/governance hardening only; no runtime semantic change.
* 11:16PM
  - Opened planning lock to expand Phase 2 in active dev-substrate build plan.
  - Scope:
    - replace coarse Phase 2 bullets with execution-ready sections and auditable DoD,
    - include explicit run/operate and obs/gov hooks for infra lifecycle commands,
    - keep changes in-place (no extra docs).
  - Constraints:
    - planning-only, no paid service execution.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning elaboration only; no runtime semantic changes.
* 11:17PM
  - Applied Phase 2 planning expansion in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
  - Replaced coarse Phase 2 outline with execution-ready sections:
    - `2.A` Terraform topology/state boundaries,
    - `2.B` core substrate,
    - `2.C` demo substrate,
    - `2.D` cost + teardown controls,
    - `2.E` run/operate onboarding,
    - `2.F` obs/gov onboarding,
    - `2.G` failure/recovery drills.
  - Tightened Phase 2 DoD to explicit closure gates (idempotency, residual destroy checks, budget/tag validation, lifecycle evidence, drift audit).
  - Updated Phase 2 status line to planning-ready with implementation pending.
  - Cost posture:
    - planning-only; no paid service/resource commands executed.
  - Drift checkpoint: planning elaboration only; no runtime semantic changes.
* 11:18PM
  - Opened full Phase 2 implementation lock per USER direction.
  - Scope pinned:
    - Terraform `core` + `demo` module implementation,
    - dev_min env composition,
    - operator lifecycle commands (`plan/up/down/status/post_destroy_check`),
    - infra evidence emission for run/operate + obs/gov posture.
  - Validation plan pinned:
    - terraform fmt/init/validate,
    - lifecycle run with idempotent destroy drill + residual check.
  - Cost posture:
    - code + static validation are no-cost,
    - if `up` runs, immediate `down` follows unless USER explicitly keeps resources on.
  - Drift checkpoint: infra lifecycle implementation only; no semantic-law drift.
* 11:30PM
  - Implemented Phase 2 infra substrate and operator lifecycle surfaces.
  - Added Terraform modules:
    - `infra/terraform/modules/core/*`
    - `infra/terraform/modules/demo/*`
  - Added env composition:
    - `infra/terraform/envs/dev_min/*`
  - Added lifecycle script:
    - `scripts/dev_substrate/phase2_terraform.ps1`
  - Added Make targets:
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-plan`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-up`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-down`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-down-all`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-status`
    - `platform-dev-min-phase2-post-destroy-check`
  - Static validation:
    - `terraform fmt` PASS,
    - `terraform init` PASS,
    - `terraform validate` PASS.
  - Runtime validation:
    - phase2-plan PASS,
    - phase2-up PASS,
    - phase2-status PASS (`resources_in_state=25` while active),
    - phase2-down PASS,
    - phase2-down rerun PASS (idempotency),
    - phase2-post-destroy-check initially FAIL (script JSON-shape bug),
    - bug fixed in `phase2_terraform.ps1`, rerun PASS,
    - phase2-down-all PASS,
    - final phase2-status PASS (`resources_in_state=0`).
  - Evidence artifacts:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/dev_substrate/phase2/infra_phase2_*`.
  - Cost decision:
    - `TURN OFF NOW` executed (all Phase 2 resources torn down by end of pass).
  - Remaining gate:
    - budget-alert runtime activation test pending explicit `DEV_MIN_ENABLE_BUDGET_ALERT=1` for account.
  - Drift checkpoint: substrate lifecycle only; no semantic or ownership drift.
* 11:31PM
  - Executed additional full teardown idempotency drill:
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase2-down-all DEV_MIN_ALLOW_PAID_DESTROY_ALL=1` -> PASS.
  - Confirms safe no-op teardown behavior when resources are already absent.
  - Cost decision remains: `TURN OFF NOW` (already satisfied; state remains empty).
* 11:32PM
  - Final verification run:
    - `terraform validate` PASS,
    - phase2-plan PASS.
  - Observed transient local-state lock during a concurrent plan/status attempt:
    - phase2-status initially FAIL_CLOSED with state-file lock message.
  - Reran phase2-status sequentially:
    - PASS (`resources_in_state=0`).
  - Operational note pinned:
    - run terraform workspace actions sequentially against the same local state path.
* 11:33PM
  - Final teardown confirmation query:
    - `aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --tag-filters Key=fp_phase,Values=phase2 ...`
    - result: `[]`.
  - Confirms no tagged Phase 2 resources remain active after `down-all`.
* 11:40PM
  - Opened budget-alert validation lock (Phase 2 DoD closure track).
  - USER intent aligned: validate budget-alert wiring without synthetic spend; set very low threshold for runtime confirmation during next platform tests.
  - Detected config gap:
    - `DEV_MIN_BUDGET_ALERT_EMAIL` missing in `.env.dev_min`.
  - Decision for this pass:
    - use temporary operator fallback from local git identity email as command override,
    - avoid writing email value into implementation docs/logbook.
  - Planned posture:
    - run phase2-up with budget alert enabled + low limit,
    - verify via AWS Budgets API,
    - keep core only (`phase2-down`) so alert remains active for near-term testing.
* 11:42PM
  - Executed budget-alert activation and config verification pass.
  - Actions:
    - `phase2-up` with `DEV_MIN_ENABLE_BUDGET_ALERT=1`, `DEV_MIN_BUDGET_LIMIT_USD=1`, and temporary subscriber-email override from local operator git identity.
    - AWS verification:
      - `describe-budget` PASS,
      - `describe-notifications-for-budget` PASS.
  - Verified config:
    - budget exists (`fraud-platform-dev-min-monthly-cost`),
    - monthly limit `USD 1.0`,
    - two ACTUAL notifications configured (80%, 100% thresholds).
  - Cost control:
    - executed `phase2-down` (demo off, core retained),
    - `phase2-status` PASS (`resources_in_state=23`),
    - `phase2-post-destroy-check` PASS (no demo-tier residual resources).
  - Build-plan alignment update:
    - budget alert activation/config verification marked complete,
    - remaining open gate pinned: observe real notification delivery during subsequent platform runtime spend.
  - Cost decision: `KEEP ON (core only)` for immediate testing window.

  - Post-validation posture snapshot:
    - `phase2-status` PASS (`resources_in_state=23`).
    - tag scan:
      - `fp_tier=demo`: `0`,
      - `fp_tier=core`: `7`.
  - Confirms budget-validation setup remains active with demo-tier spend surfaces off.

  - Opened corrective policy shift for env handling in dev-substrate track.
  - USER direction:
    - use only `.env.dev_min`,
    - avoid tracked `.env` example artifacts.
  - Planned actions:
    - remove `.env.dev_min.example`,
    - update Make target messaging and build-plan wording to local-only env instructions.
  - Cost posture:
    - no cloud/resource actions for this change.
  - Drift checkpoint: process/documentation correction only; no runtime semantics changed.
* 11:46PM
  - Applied local-only `.env.dev_min` policy in active surfaces.
  - Changes:
    - removed `.env.dev_min.example` from workspace,
    - updated Phase 1/2 Make target messages to local-only `.env.dev_min` guidance,
    - updated build-plan dedicated env surface wording to remove template reference.
  - Note:
    - historical entries still mention `.env.dev_min.example` as prior state; current policy is now local-only.
  - Cost posture:
    - no cloud/resource actions executed.
