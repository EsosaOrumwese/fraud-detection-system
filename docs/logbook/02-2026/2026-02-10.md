* 03:32AM
  - Added a platform implementation-note entry documenting:
    - the accepted successful full-platform run (`platform_20260209T231403Z`) with evidence paths,
    - the current implemented live-stream flow narrative across meta-layer, C&I, RTDL core, decision lane, case/label lane, and obs/gov lane.
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 03:33AM
  - Updated local parity runbook to reflect current implemented services and runtime posture:
    - added case bus stream (`fp.bus.case.v1`) to preconditions/bootstrap expectations,
    - added `platform-operate-obs-gov-up` to explicit startup commands,
    - added obs/gov pack file to pack inventory,
    - added obs/gov scope note under orchestration,
    - documented reporter concurrency caveat (`platform-run-report` vs reporter worker),
    - added explicit `20 -> 200` full-stream gate pattern with evidence paths.
  - Updated file:
    - `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md`.

* 03:34AM
  - Normalized timestamp heading style in `docs/logbook/02-2026/2026-02-09.md` to the project’s standard bullet-time format (`* HH:MMPM`) for consistency with existing logbook conventions.
