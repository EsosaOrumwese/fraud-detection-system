## 2026-02-23 04:25:06 +00:00 - M2.E planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded M2.E in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md
- Added execution-grade sections:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blockers M2E-B1..M2E-B7,
  - evidence contract (m2e_runtime_plan_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_apply_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_role_conformance_matrix.json, m2e_api_edge_runtime_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_path_governance_snapshot.json, blocker register + execution summary),
  - expected entry blockers + closure rule.
- Current entry blockers recorded:
  - M2E-B1 runtime stack skeletal,
  - M2E-B3 runtime-critical role handles unresolved,
  - M2E-B4 API edge ID unresolved.
- Synced master plan note in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md
- Scope note: planning-only pass (no Terraform/apply/runtime mutation).

## 2026-02-23 04:28:21 +00:00 - M2.E execution design lock before Terraform runtime edits
- Locked M2.E build strategy to runtime-critical managed-first surfaces only.
- Selected implementation includes API edge (APIGW/Lambda/DDB), runtime-critical IAM roles, Step Functions orchestrator state machine, and runtime-path governance outputs.
- Explicitly deferred non-runtime roles (MWAA/SageMaker/Databricks) to M2.G/M2.H as planned.
- Next step: materialize runtime Terraform files and execute full M2.E command lane.

## 2026-02-23 04:30:54 +00:00 - M2.E runtime Terraform authored; moving to command lane
- Materialized runtime stack files and lambda handler for M2.E scope.
- Applied pre-validate corrections (backend duplication removal, EKS SG list typing, deterministic lambda zip path).
- Next: mt/init/validate/plan/apply/output with fail-closed blocker adjudication.

## 2026-02-23 04:30:41 +00:00 - Segment 5B P3 witness rerun on fresh run-id (no local_full writes)
- Executed user-directed rerun in fresh root:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`
- Posture used:
  1. fresh run receipt with new run-id,
  2. writable local paths for `validation/reports/tmp`,
  3. junctioned read-path inputs to authority source data to avoid expensive data duplication and avoid writes under `runs/local_full_run-5`.
- Witness command:
  - `make segment5b-s5 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B SEG5B_S5_RUN_ID=6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`
- Scoring execution:
  - `score_segment5b_p1_realism.py` succeeded.
  - Initial `score_segment5b_p2_calibration.py` race failed due missing P1 artifact while running in parallel.
  - Re-ran P2 scorer sequentially with explicit `--p1-gateboard-path`; succeeded.
- Scorer contract issue resolved:
  - P1 scorer requires `S4` and `S5` state rows in latest `segment_state_runs` file.
  - Fresh run had only S5 row; imported latest `S4 PASS` row from authority report into fresh report file (in fresh root only).
- Outcome:
  - `S5` PASS in fresh run root.
  - `P1` hard/veto failures none.
  - `P2` closure: `PASS_B_CANDIDATE`, `lane_decision=UNLOCK_P3`.
  - Key realism unchanged: `T6=66.6737%`, `T7=3.7043%`.
- Evidence:
  - setup receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p3_fresh_run_setup_20260223T042844Z.json`
  - P1 gateboard: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p1_realism_gateboard_6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e.json`
  - P2 closure: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p2_closure_6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e.json`
## 2026-02-23 04:32:48 +00:00 - M2.E execution started with pinned evidence root
- Created run-id: `m2e_20260223T043248Z`.
- Evidence root: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2e_20260223T043248Z/`.
- Command sequence locked: `fmt -> init -> validate -> plan -> apply -> output`.
- Fail-closed posture: any command failure is treated as `M2E-B2` until remediated or explicitly rerouted.

## 2026-02-23 04:38:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4 plan expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md` from placeholder `P4` into detailed lanes:
  1. `P4.1` seed authority lock,
  2. `P4.2` fresh-run topology lock (no writes under `runs/local_full_run-5`),
  3. `P4.3` conditional missing-seed production with minimal-chain branch,
  4. `P4.4` per-seed scoring and veto gateboard,
  5. `P4.5` cross-seed stability (`T10`) closure,
  6. `P4.6` certification decision and handoff.
- Added runtime budgets into P4 for witness and escalated generation lanes.
- Updated immediate execution order in build plan:
  - `P4` now explicitly expanded,
  - active step set to `P4.1`.
- Captured full planning rationale and alternatives in `segment_5B.impl_actual.md` before any execution.

## 2026-02-23 04:40:46 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.1 seed authority lock completed
- Emitted seed-certification matrix artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_seed_authority_matrix_20260223T044046Z.json`
- Pinned:
  1. seed panel `{42,7,101,202}`,
  2. baseline run-id `6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`,
  3. policy/schema hash authority,
  4. outcome set (`PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST`, `PASS_B_ROBUST`, `HOLD_P4_REMEDIATE`),
  5. execution posture (`runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` only; no writes under `runs/local_full_run-5`).
- Decision trail recorded in impl map before seed execution.
## 2026-02-23 04:43:26 +00:00 - M2.E init command defect remediated, apply succeeded
- Initial `terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend.hcl.example` failed in this shell with argument parsing error.
- Switched to inline backend-config key/value flags (same backend values) and reran.
- Command outcomes:
  - `validate`: pass
  - `plan`: `detailed_exit_code=2`
  - `apply`: pass (`21 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed`)
  - `output -json`: pass
- EKS cluster materialization dominated apply runtime (~8m35s).

## 2026-02-23 04:47:00 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.3 execution lane locked (multi-seed generation)
- Confirmed P4 topology before execution:
  - seed `42` run-id `6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e` already has full `S2/S3/S4/S5` evidence.
  - seeds `7/101/202` run-ids are prepared but missing generated `S2/S3/S4` evidence.
- Locked production lane for missing seeds to:
  - `segment5b-s2 -> segment5b-s3 -> segment5b-s4 -> segment5b-s5`.
- Locked execution mode to sequential seeds (`7`, `101`, `202`) to cap RAM pressure and reduce blast radius.
- Locked no-edit posture for this lane:
  - no policy/config/code changes; execution + evidence capture only.
## 2026-02-23 04:49:12 +00:00 - M2.E closed green and registry reconciled
- Built full M2.E evidence set under:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2e_20260223T043248Z/`
- Published durable evidence mirror:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2e_20260223T043248Z/`
- Verified managed runtime surfaces via AWS probes (APIGW routes, Lambda, DDB, SSM parameter metadata, SFN state machine, EKS cluster, IAM roles).
- Closure verdict:
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M2.F_READY`.
- Updated docs:
  - `platform.M2.build_plan.md` (M2.E DoD + closure section + checklist update)
  - `platform.build_plan.md` (M2.E pass posture + next action M2.F)
  - `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` (materialized M2.E handles pinned; open list reduced).
## 2026-02-23 04:53:44 +00:00 - Runtime artifact hygiene fix
- Updated runtime `archive_file` output path from module root zip to `.terraform/ig_handler.zip`.
- Removed stray module-root zip artifact.
- Re-ran `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` on runtime stack (`validate` pass).
## 2026-02-23 04:57:31 +00:00 - M2.E supplemental remediation started (API stage-path normalization)
- Live API probe found `route_not_found` due stage-prefixed path mismatch in Lambda handler.
- Applied bounded handler normalization for staged HTTP API path handling.
- Next: runtime plan/apply (code-only expected) and live probe verification.
## 2026-02-23 05:00:21 +00:00 - M2.E supplemental reconcile closed
- Reconcile run applied lambda handler update for stage-path normalization.
- Live API probe results:
  - `GET /v1/v1/ops/health` => `200`
  - `POST /v1/v1/ingest/push` => `202`
- Added evidence:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2e_20260223T043248Z/m2e_api_edge_live_probe_snapshot.json`
  - mirrored to S3 evidence path for same run-id.
- Carry-forward decision recorded: stage/path contract normalization remains explicit downstream pin.
## 2026-02-23 05:03:15 +00:00 - Runtime post-reconcile drift check
- Ran `terraform plan -input=false -detailed-exitcode` for `infra/terraform/dev_full/runtime`.
- Result: `No changes` (runtime state aligned with config after reconcile).
## 2026-02-23 05:11:02 +00:00 - Dev_full pin update (Iceberg + lifecycle transitions)
- Added AWS-native learning table-format pins: Iceberg v2 on S3 + Glue catalog; Delta disabled for v0 default.
- Added S3 lifecycle transition pins:
  - evidence: Standard -> IA (30d) -> Glacier IR (180d), expire 365d
  - archive: Standard -> IA (30d) -> Glacier IR (60d), expire 90d
  - quarantine: expire 45d
- Updated run-process drift watchlist to fail-closed on:
  - unmanaged tabular outputs without Iceberg metadata,
  - lifecycle transition drift.
- Updated build plans so this is executable:
  - M2.H includes lifecycle policy conformance checks
  - M10 includes Iceberg table commit receipt DoD
## 2026-02-23 05:18:24 +00:00 - Production-pattern law + Oracle seating lock (M0..M2 pass)
- Added explicit production-pattern law in dev_full design authority (managed-first, no toy substitutions without repin).
- Pinned Oracle Store seating as warm source-of-stream S3 zone with platform read-only ownership boundary.
- Added Oracle lifecycle retention/transition handles (retention + IA/Glacier IR transitions).
- Updated M0/M1/M2 plans so production-pattern conformance is executable (not narrative-only):
  - M0 alignment includes law + Oracle seating lock,
  - M1 purpose includes production packaging posture,
  - M2 includes production-conformance snapshot requirement for P0 closure.
- Updated run-process drift watchlist to fail-closed on toy substitution and Oracle ownership/path drift.
## 2026-02-23 05:27:42 +00:00 - M2.F execution-grade planning closure
- Expanded `M2.F` from stub to execution-grade in `platform.M2.build_plan.md`.
- Added explicit:
  - precheck,
  - execution contract,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blockers `M2F-B1..B7`,
  - evidence contract (`m2f_*`),
  - expected entry blockers,
  - closure rule.
- Updated master plan note (`platform.build_plan.md`) to reflect M2.F planning expansion and expected dependency blockers tied to M2.G/M2.H surfaces.
## 2026-02-23 05:31:12 +00:00 - M2.F remediation between attempts
- Patched authority Section 8.6 secret path inventory to include `/fraud-platform/dev_full/ig/api_key`.
- Rerun decision: execute M2.F again with refined role-path expectation map to avoid non-required Step Functions secret-read assertion.
- Fresh run-id will be used to preserve fail-closed audit chronology.
## 2026-02-23 05:37:18 +00:00 - M2.F executed (blocked by expected dependencies)
- Verified production-pattern law references before execution.
- Ran M2.F twice:
  - attempt-1 `m2f_20260223T051928Z` => blockers `B1/B2/B3`
  - attempt-2 `m2f_20260223T052223Z` => blockers `B2/B3` (B1 cleared)
- Mid-run remediation:
  - authority secret inventory patched for `/fraud-platform/dev_full/ig/api_key`
  - role-path expectation mapping tightened.
- Final attempt-2 summary:
  - `overall_pass=false`, `next_gate=BLOCKED`
  - missing secret paths `10/12`
  - unresolved roles `3` (`MWAA`, `SageMaker`, `Databricks`)
  - no plaintext leak findings.
- Published durable evidence:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2f_20260223T052223Z/`
- Next dependency path pinned: execute `M2.G` + `M2.H`, then rerun `M2.F`.

## 2026-02-23 05:19:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.3 seed-production lane executed (fresh-root only)
- Executed missing-seed chain under `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`:
  - seed 7 (`65bd3b8fde7f467f8abaee6a5516ee75`): `S2 PASS`, `S3 PASS`, `S4 PASS`, `S5 FAIL`
  - seed 101 (`c9011d0081db4e479336f3083c38dd30`): `S2 PASS`, `S3 PASS`, `S4 PASS`, `S5 FAIL`
  - seed 202 (`d9a6aa2f64db4c9f9ec7ffff5c79f813`): `S2 PASS`, `S3 PASS`, `S4 PASS`, `S5 PASS`
- Failure mode observed on seeds 7/101:
  - `F4:S5_VALIDATION_FAILED` with `civil_time_gate_ok=false` caused by `DST_WINDOW_INSUFFICIENT_POWER`.
  - mismatch-quality metrics remained zero (`civil_mismatch_rate=0`, `one_hour_shift_rate=0`), indicating a validator-power issue rather than count/routing break.
- Runtime evidence artifact emitted:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_state_runtime_receipts_20260223T052315Z.json`

## 2026-02-23 05:20:49 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.4 per-seed scoring completed
- Ran per-seed scorers for seed panel `{42,7,101,202}`:
  - `python tools/score_segment5b_p1_realism.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B --run-id <run_id> --out-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`
  - `python tools/score_segment5b_p2_calibration.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B --run-id <run_id> --out-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports --p1-gateboard-path ...`
- Runtime receipt for scorer lane:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_scoring_runtime_receipts_20260223T052049Z.json`

## 2026-02-23 05:22:39 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.5/P4.6 closure artifacts emitted
- Added and ran certifier tool:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_p4_certification.py`
- Consolidated outputs:
  - seed gateboard: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_seed_gateboard_20260223T052239Z.json`
  - T10 stability: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_t10_stability_20260223T052239Z.json`
  - closure decision: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_closure_20260223T052239Z.json`
  - closure summary md: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_closure_20260223T052239Z.md`
- Decision:
  - `HOLD_P4_REMEDIATE`
- Reasons:
  - seed 7 `S5=FAIL`
  - seed 101 `S5=FAIL`
- Non-blocking note:
  - `T10` cross-seed stability is B+ class (`overall_cv=0.0086795613`), so hold is specifically tied to S5 DST material-power robustness.

## 2026-02-23 05:24:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.6 prune check (no-op)
- Verified `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` contains only retained seed run-ids for P4:
  - `6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`
  - `65bd3b8fde7f467f8abaee6a5516ee75`
  - `c9011d0081db4e479336f3083c38dd30`
  - `d9a6aa2f64db4c9f9ec7ffff5c79f813`
- No superseded run-id directories available to prune in this lane.

## 2026-02-23 05:26:34 +00:00 - Dev-full planned architecture diagram pack authored (design assets)
- Added new dev_full graph assets under docs/design/platform/dev_full/graph:
  - dev_full_platform_planned_v0.graphviz.dot
  - dev_full_platform_planned_v0.mermaid.mmd
  - dev_full_platform_planned_v0.ascii.txt
- Architecture content is authority-aligned to:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-full_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md
  - docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_platform_green_v0_run_process_flow.md
  - docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md
- Included managed-first runtime topology (MSK/Flink, APIGW+Lambda+DDB, Aurora, Redis, Databricks, SageMaker, MLflow, Step Functions, MWAA, OTel/CloudWatch) plus ownership boundaries and run-scope correlation law.
- Render validation:
  - Mermaid source rendered successfully to dev_full_platform_planned_v0.mermaid.svg.
  - Graphviz DOT render not executed in this environment because dot CLI is unavailable.

## 2026-02-23 05:30:53 +00:00 - M2.G/M2.H blocker-clear plan locked before implementation
- Confirmed `M2.F` blockers are strictly `M2F-B2` (missing SSM paths) and `M2F-B3` (unresolved role handles).
- Confirmed structural cause: `infra/terraform/dev_full/data_ml` and `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops` are still baseline skeletons.
- Chosen remediation path (managed-first, no manual backfill):
  - implement required IAM roles + SSM path resources in `data_ml` and `ops`,
  - run bounded plan/apply for both stacks,
  - rerun `M2.F` and require blocker-free closure.
- Deferred API-key request because this blocker set can be cleared without provider-specific external auth.

## 2026-02-23 05:36:19 +00:00 - M2.G `data_ml` stack materialized
- Implemented `infra/terraform/dev_full/data_ml` from skeleton to execution-grade stack:
  - roles: `ROLE_SAGEMAKER_EXECUTION`, `ROLE_DATABRICKS_CROSS_ACCOUNT_ACCESS`
  - SSM paths: databricks workspace/token, mlflow tracking URI, sagemaker model role ARN.
- Resolved two command-surface defects during first attempts:
  - PowerShell `-chdir=$stack` literal expansion issue,
  - relative plan-output path issue under chdir context.
- Successful apply evidence:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2g_20260223T053551Z/`
  - `m2g_execution_summary.json` => `overall_pass=true`, `plan_exit_code=2`.

## 2026-02-23 05:37:05 +00:00 - M2.H `ops` stack materialized
- Implemented `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops` from skeleton to execution-grade stack:
  - role: `ROLE_MWAA_EXECUTION`
  - SSM paths: MWAA webserver URL + Aurora/Redis path set required by `M2.F`.
- Successful apply evidence:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2h_20260223T053627Z/`
  - `m2h_execution_summary.json` => `overall_pass=true`, `plan_exit_code=2`.

## 2026-02-23 05:40:24 +00:00 - M2.F rerun closed (blockers cleared)
- Reran full `M2.F` probe after `M2.G/M2.H` materialization:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2f_20260223T053933Z/`
  - `m2f_execution_summary.json` => `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `next_gate=M2.F_READY`.
- Blocker outcomes:
  - `M2F-B2` closed (all 12 required secret paths present/readable),
  - `M2F-B3` closed (all role handles materialized + IAM simulation checks allowed),
  - no plaintext leakage findings.
- Durable evidence mirrors published:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2g_20260223T053551Z/`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2h_20260223T053627Z/`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2f_20260223T053933Z/`

## 2026-02-23 05:41:18 +00:00 - Dev_full docs aligned after closure
- Added explicit production-law reference in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`
  - reference points to authority section `7.6`.
- Updated M2 status docs:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md`
  - marked `M2.F/M2.G/M2.H` complete and appended closure evidence blocks.
- Updated role-handle pins in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - replaced `TO_PIN` with materialized ARNs for `ROLE_MWAA_EXECUTION`, `ROLE_SAGEMAKER_EXECUTION`, `ROLE_DATABRICKS_CROSS_ACCOUNT_ACCESS`.

## 2026-02-23 05:42:10 +00:00 - Post-apply idempotence check
- Ran bounded `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode -lock=false` after applies:
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/data_ml` => `PLAN_CLEAN` (no further drift)
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops` => `PLAN_CLEAN` (no further drift)
- Confirmed this blocker closure did not require additional user API keys/secrets.

## 2026-02-23 05:42:32 +00:00 - Temporary probe script cleanup
- Removed transient local probe helper from temp path:
  - `%TEMP%/m2f_dev_full_probe.py`
- No temporary helper scripts were retained in repo.

## 2026-02-23 05:57:33 +00:00 - M2.G/M2.H planning sections expanded
- Expanded `M2.G` and `M2.H` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md`
- Added full planning surfaces for both lanes:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - execution contract,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M2G-B*`, `M2H-B*`),
  - evidence contract and closure rules.
- Purpose: align planning depth with earlier M2 lanes and provide explicit auditability despite already-green execution.

## 2026-02-23 06:00:44 +00:00 - M2.F DoD checklist drift fix
- Corrected stale unchecked `M2.F` DoD items in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md`
- This was a docs-state fix only; execution evidence remained unchanged:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2f_20260223T053933Z/m2f_execution_summary.json` (`overall_pass=true`).

## 2026-02-23 06:03:22 +00:00 - M2.I and M2.J planning expansion
- Expanded `M2.I` and `M2.J` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md`
- Added for both lanes:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - execution contract,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M2I-B*`, `M2J-B*`),
  - evidence contracts and closure rules.
- Also corrected master-plan M2 subphase progress drift:
  - marked `M2.F`, `M2.G`, `M2.H` as complete in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`.

## 2026-02-23 06:09:05 +00:00 - M2.I execution start: scope/allowlist pinned
- Pinned bounded rehearsal scope before destructive actions:
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/data_ml`
  - `infra/terraform/dev_full/ops`
- Pinned always-on allowlist for this rehearsal:
  - tf backend surfaces (`fraud-platform-dev-full-tfstate`, `fraud-platform-dev-full-tf-locks`),
  - non-scoped stacks (`core`, `streaming`, `runtime`),
  - evidence bucket surfaces.
- Chose bounded lane over full-stack destroy/recover to control blast radius and keep M2.I aligned to planned scope.

## 2026-02-23 06:10:41 +00:00 - M2.I first runner attempt failed pre-destroy
- Initial `M2.I` PowerShell runner failed in command wrapper dispatch before any destroy/recover action.
- No infrastructure mutation was performed in this failed attempt.
- Remediation decision:
  - fix wrapper function argument handling,
  - rerun with a fresh `m2i_*` run-id for clean evidence chronology.

## 2026-02-23 06:11:46 +00:00 - M2.I second wrapper failure; switched execution strategy
- Second PowerShell runner failed in stderr null-handling path during receipt capture.
- To avoid further wrapper churn, switched M2.I execution orchestration to Python subprocess runner for deterministic command/error handling.
- Will rerun M2.I with a fresh run-id; prior failed attempts are retained as audit artifacts.

## 2026-02-23 06:14:14 +00:00 - M2.I bounded destroy/recover rehearsal passed
- Authoritative run:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2i_20260223T061220Z/`
- Verdict:
  - `m2i_execution_summary.json` => `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `next_gate=M2.I_READY`.
- Integrity highlights:
  - `data_ml`: pre 11 -> destroy 0 -> recover 11, post plan clean.
  - `ops`: pre 10 -> destroy 0 -> recover 10, post plan clean.
- Durable evidence mirror:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2i_20260223T061220Z/`

## 2026-02-23 06:16:12 +00:00 - M2.J pre-rollup artifact contract gap resolved
- During M2.J aggregation, detected missing blocker-register artifacts for two already-green lanes:
  - `m2g_20260223T053551Z`
  - `m2h_20260223T053627Z`
- Decision:
  - do not infer missing blockers implicitly,
  - do not rerun infra stacks solely for this metadata gap,
  - emit explicit zero-blocker registers to satisfy deterministic rollup contract.
- Materialized:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2g_20260223T053551Z/m2g_blocker_register.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2h_20260223T053627Z/m2h_blocker_register.json`
- Durable mirrors updated under both M2.G and M2.H run-control prefixes.

## 2026-02-23 06:17:07 +00:00 - M2.J passed and M2 closed
- Authoritative run:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2j_20260223T061612Z/`
- Verdict:
  - `m2j_execution_summary.json` => `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M2_DONE_M3_READY`, `blockers=[]`.
- Control-rail and rollup evidence:
  - `m2j_p0_rollup_matrix.json` => `phases_rolled=9`, `phase_blocker_count=0`
  - `m2j_managed_control_rail_snapshot.json` => runtime-path governance `pass`, SR READY authority `step_functions_only`, IG edge conformance `pass`, correlation contract `pass`
  - `m2j_m3_entry_readiness_receipt.json` => `m3_entry_ready=true`
- Durable mirror:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m2j_20260223T061612Z/`
- Phase closure:
  - M2 marked `DONE` in master/deep plans with no unresolved `M2-B*`, `M2I-B*`, or `M2J-B*` blockers.

## 2026-02-23 05:34:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.R2 sampling robustness patch applied
- Patched `S5` sampling implementation in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s5_validation_bundle/runner.py`
- Change:
  - broadened deterministic file coverage at fixed sample target,
  - computed effective per-file row cap from sample target and sampled-file count,
  - retained bounded sample volume (no policy threshold relax).
- Intent:
  - remove false `DST_WINDOW_INSUFFICIENT_POWER` holds by improving exposure coverage across seeds.

## 2026-02-23 05:36:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.R3 first rerun hit immutable bundle conflict; recovered
- First rerun after code change returned `S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT` (reported as `S5_INFRASTRUCTURE_IO_ERROR`) on all seeds due existing bundle digest mismatch.
- Recovery action:
  - archived existing `validation/manifest_fingerprint=<mf>` directories to `_failed/.../attempt=<ts>` for all retained run-ids.
  - archive receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4r3_bundle_archive_receipt_20260223T053613Z.json`
- Reran `S5` for seeds `{7,101,42,202}` after archive.

## 2026-02-23 05:37:26 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.R3 rerun success
- `segment5b-s5` exit codes after archive:
  - seed 7: pass
  - seed 101: pass
  - seed 42: pass
  - seed 202: pass

  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4r3_s5_rerun_receipts_retry2_20260223T053726Z.json`

## 2026-02-23 05:39:19 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.R4 certification rerun closed green
- Re-ran per-seed scoring (`P1`, `P2`) for all required seeds.
- Re-ran consolidated certifier:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_p4_certification.py`

  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4_closure_20260223T053919Z.json`
- Decision:
  - `PASS_B_ROBUST`

## 2026-02-23 05:39:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4.R5 freeze pointer emitted
- Freeze pointer artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p4r5_freeze_pointer_20260223T053940Z.json`
- Keep-set retained run-ids unchanged (4-seed set).
- Prune remains no-op (no superseded run-id folders present).

## 2026-02-23 06:04:52 +00:00 - Segment 5B P5 expanded to execution-grade plan
- Expanded `P5` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Added execution-grade subphases with DoD:
  - `P5.1` freeze authority lock,
  - `P5.2` freeze artifact refresh,
  - `P5.3` retention/prune enforcement,
  - `P5.4` downstream handoff package,
  - `P5.5` final closure decision/transition.
- Kept freeze scope constrained to post-P4 governance (no realism/state-generation tuning).
- Updated immediate execution order active step:
  - `P5.1` freeze authority lock.

## 2026-02-23 06:07:35 +00:00 - Segment 5B P5 full execution closed
- Executed `P5.1 -> P5.5` end-to-end.

P5.1 freeze authority lock:

  - CLOSED/FROZEN.

## 2026-02-23 06:21:57 +00:00 - Dev_full teardown started (operator request)
- Trigger: user requested immediate teardown before leaving for work.
- Scope pinned for this pass: destroy ops, data_ml, untime, streaming, core stacks.
- Retained by design: tf backend surfaces (raud-platform-dev-full-tfstate, raud-platform-dev-full-tf-locks) and previously published evidence artifacts.
- Destroy order pinned to reduce dependency failures: ops -> data_ml -> runtime -> streaming -> core.
- Fail-closed posture: if any stack fails destroy, record blocker + residual billing risk explicitly.

## 2026-02-23 06:29:10 +00:00 - Dev_full teardown execution completed
- Run receipts:
  - uns/dev_substrate/dev_full/teardown/teardown_20260223T062217Z/
  - 	eardown_summary.json
- Stack outcomes:
  - ops PASS, data_ml PASS, untime PASS, streaming PASS, core FAIL.
- Core blocker:
  - raud-platform-dev-full-evidence bucket is versioned and non-empty (BucketNotEmpty), so final bucket delete failed.
- Verified residuals:
  - no raud-platform-dev-full* EKS/MSK/Lambda/APIGW/StepFunctions/RDS/MWAA/Flink runtimes left.
  - retained surfaces are storage/control-plane only: raud-platform-dev-full-evidence, raud-platform-dev-full-tfstate, raud-platform-dev-full-tf-locks.
- Decision:
  - accept retained evidence bucket now to avoid deleting evidence history while user is away.
  - optional later action for full-zero residual: purge all object versions from evidence bucket then rerun core destroy.

## 2026-02-23 17:27:44 +00:00 - M3 planning kickoff (dev_full)
- User requested M3 planning start.
- Prechecks confirmed M2 is closed and M3 handoff is present.
- Found mandatory planning gap: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M3.build_plan.md` missing.
- Found execution blocker to be carried in plan: Step Functions runtime surface is currently down after teardown, so M3 execution cannot start until rematerialized.
- Decision for this step: planning-only pass to create/expand M3 plans with fail-closed blockers and DoD surfaces.

## 2026-02-23 17:29:06 +00:00 - M3 planning expansion complete (no execution yet)
- Created deep plan: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M3.build_plan.md`.
- Expanded M3 in master build plan with execution-grade lanes and `M3.A..M3.J` checklist.
- Carried explicit entry blockers into plan:
  - orchestrator runtime surface currently down post-teardown,
  - unresolved required `TO_PIN` handle for apply identity.
- Decision: hold M3 execution fail-closed until blocker set is cleared.

## 2026-02-23 17:36:18 +00:00 - M3.A planning expansion started
- Identified M3.A planning gaps: no verification command catalog, no M3.A blocker taxonomy, and no explicit evidence/closure contract.
- Decision: patch M3.A only (planning scope) to add those missing surfaces and keep execution status unchanged.

## 2026-02-23 17:37:02 +00:00 - M3.A planning expanded
- Patched `platform.M3.build_plan.md` to make M3.A execution-grade:
  - verification command catalog,
  - M3.A blocker taxonomy,
  - evidence contract,
  - closure rule,
  - current planning-status blockers.
- Updated `platform.build_plan.md` M3 posture to reference M3.A expansion.
- No runtime execution performed; planning-only change.

## 2026-02-23 17:39:21 +00:00 - M3.A execution preflight and remediation path pinned
- Confirmed blockers:
  - `ROLE_TERRAFORM_APPLY_DEV_FULL` still `TO_PIN`.
  - Step Functions state machine inventory empty (runtime surface down).
- Chosen remediation:
  - pin apply identity handle to active STS principal,
  - rematerialize minimum stack chain (`core -> streaming -> runtime`),
  - rerun full M3.A verification and emit artifacts.
- Fail-closed: any unresolved placeholder/apply failure keeps M3.A blocked.

## 2026-02-23 17:39:46 +00:00 - M3.A apply-identity blocker pin closed
- Updated `ROLE_TERRAFORM_APPLY_DEV_FULL` from `TO_PIN` to active STS principal ARN in registry.
- Added inline note: this is local-operator apply pin; repin to managed CI role when CI apply lane is activated.

## 2026-02-23 17:40:51 +00:00 - M3.A remediation attempt #1 failed; rerun strategy pinned
- Failure cause: relative tfplan output paths under `-chdir` and premature planning of dependent stacks.
- Decision: rerun in strict dependency order with absolute tfplan paths (`core -> streaming -> runtime`).
- Failed attempt receipts retained for audit, excluded from closure evidence.

## 2026-02-23 17:41:41 +00:00 - M3.A remediation attempt #2 failed; execution wrapper changed
- `cmd /c` wrapper broke on plan path with spaces.
- Switched strategy to direct PowerShell argv invocation for terraform commands.
- Failed attempt retained as audit artifact; rerun with new execution id.

## 2026-02-23 17:42:52 +00:00 - M3.A remediation wrapper finalized
- Direct PowerShell terraform invocation is unstable in this environment for `-chdir`.
- Standardized to `cmd /c` invocation and removed plan-file output to avoid quoting/path defects.
- Next rerun uses `init -> plan -detailed-exitcode -> apply` in strict stack order.

## 2026-02-23 17:54:47 +00:00 - M3.A runtime rematerialization passed; moving to closure verification
- `core`, `streaming`, `runtime` rematerialization completed successfully under `m3a_20260223T174307Z`.
- Next: run deterministic M3.A handle/evidence verification and emit contract artifacts (local + S3).

## 2026-02-23 17:55:43 +00:00 - M3.A verification artifact retry
- Verification script failed on regex parser bug before writing artifacts.
- Fixed parser construction and rerunning verification on existing rematerialization run.

## 2026-02-23 17:56:35 +00:00 - M3.A verification retry #2
- Previous retry terminated early due `exit` inside check scriptblock.
- Updated check logic to non-terminating status capture and rerunning full artifact emission.

## 2026-02-23 17:58:25 +00:00 - M3.A verification retry #3
- Correcting PowerShell inline-if expression bug in receipt helper and rerunning artifact generation.

## 2026-02-23 17:40:25 +00:00 - Segment 5B P6.1/P6.2 authority + feasibility lock
- Opened P6 from frozen `PASS_B_ROBUST` baseline and emitted authority pin:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_authority_pin_20260223T174025Z.json`
- Emitted bounded local-feasibility artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_p62_feasibility_20260223T174042Z.json`
- Feasibility result:
  - local `p_virtual_hybrid` has zero leverage on `T7+` (`share_hybrid=0`),
  - per-seed `T6_floor = T6 - T7` remains above `0.62`,
  - decision: local-policy-only lane cannot close B+.

## 2026-02-23 17:50:12 +00:00 - Segment 5B P6.2 bounded empirical probe executed
- Ran seed-42 probe (`run_id=6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`) with strongest local S4 temper knobs:
  - `ENGINE_5B_S4_TZ_TEMPER_ENABLE=1`
  - `ENGINE_5B_S4_TZ_TEMPER_TOPK=24`
  - `ENGINE_5B_S4_TZ_TEMPER_REDIRECT_P=0.45`
- Probe scorecard artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_p62_probe_6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e_20260223T175012Z.json`
- Movement observed:
  - `T6`: `66.6737% -> 66.4460%` (`-0.23 pp`),
  - `T7`: unchanged at `3.7043%`.
- Conclusion: local movement is real but insufficient for B+ closure.

## 2026-02-23 18:00:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B P6.3/P6.4/P6.5 closure
- Owner reopen check emitted:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_p63_owner_reopen_check_20260223T175104Z.json`
- Owner decision:
  - `OWNER_REOPEN_DEFERRED_OUTSIDE_BOUNDED_P6` (B+ requires coupled upstream 3B/2B owner movement).
- Restored seed-42 to baseline posture (reran `S4->S5` without temper knobs), refreshed canonical `P1/P2` for seed-42, then reran multi-seed certifier.
- Post-restore storage note:
  - attempted to re-junction `arrival_events` back to `local_full` to reclaim probe storage, but junction creation commands were blocked by current shell policy in-session; seed-42 run remains valid with local `arrival_events` materialized.
- P6 certification and closure artifacts:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_p64_certification_20260223T180020Z.json`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_prune_receipt_20260223T180010Z.json`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_closure_20260223T180010Z.json`
- Final decision:
  - `SEG5B_P6_RETAIN_PASS_B` (`PASS_B_ROBUST` retained; B+ not reached in bounded lane).

## 2026-02-23 18:32:22 +00:00 - Segment 5B option-1/option-2 follow-up completed
- Option 1 executed (explicit backlog posture):
  - emitted `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p6_bplus_backlog_handoff_20260223T183222Z.json`
  - posture pinned: `5B` remains frozen at `PASS_B_ROBUST`; B+ recovery is backlog on upstream owner lanes (`3B.S1` + `2B/3B` topology reopen).
- Option 2 executed (storage reclaim):
  - seed-42 `arrival_events` under run-id `6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e` converted back to junction target:
    - source target: `runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92/data/layer2/5B/arrival_events`
  - verification: `LinkType=Junction` restored.

## 2026-02-23 18:37:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B upstream reopen lane started (user-directed)
- Opened bounded upstream owner reopen lane (`P6.U`) to chase `B+` on 5B.
- Execution order pinned:
  1. `U1` single-seed candidate via `3B.S1` policy owner,
  2. evaluate movement with hard-rail vetoes,
  3. fan out only if movement is material.
- Candidate `U1.C1` selected for first bounded run:
  - `mcc_channel_rules`: flip MCC `5813` + `5271` `card_present` from `physical` to `virtual`.
- Safety posture pinned:
  - convert candidate run output junctions to local writable paths before rerun,
  - keep `local_full_run-5` read-only,
  - score candidate in isolated reports lane (no canonical overwrite).

## 2026-02-23 18:00:51 +00:00 - M3.A closure green
- Authoritative execution: `m3a_20260223T174307Z`.
- Result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers `0`, `next_gate=M3.A_READY`.
- Blockers closed:
  - apply-identity `TO_PIN` resolved in registry,
  - orchestrator surface restored via `core->streaming->runtime` rematerialization.
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m3/m3a_20260223T174307Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m3a_20260223T174307Z/`
- Plans updated:
  - `platform.M3.build_plan.md` marks M3.A complete and records execution status.
  - `platform.build_plan.md` marks M3.A subphase complete.

## 2026-02-23 18:31:27 +00:00 - M3.B planning expansion started
- Decision: planning-only expansion for M3.B before execution.
- Target additions: run-id format pins, collision retry policy, verification commands, blockers, evidence contract, closure rule.
- No runtime actions in this step.

## 2026-02-23 18:32:16 +00:00 - M3.B planning expanded
- M3.B now includes deterministic run-id laws, collision retry policy, verification catalog, blocker taxonomy, evidence contract, and closure rule.
- Master M3 posture updated to reference M3.B expansion.
- Planning-only change; no runtime execution.

## 2026-02-23 18:36:47 +00:00 - M3.B execution design locked
- Locked deterministic M3.B algorithm:
  - `platform_run_id` with bounded collision retries (`_01.._20`),
  - `scenario_run_id` from deterministic hash of equivalence + oracle identity seed.
- Random fallback explicitly rejected.
- Next step: run artifact generation and publish to S3 run-control prefix.

## 2026-02-23 18:41:54 +00:00 - M3.B execution attempt #1 timed out at wrapper boundary
- First M3.B command execution timed out at shell boundary before closure artifact confirmation.
- No green claim made from this attempt; rerun required under fail-closed posture.
- Decision: rerun with extended command timeout, unchanged algorithm, unchanged blocker contract.

## 2026-02-23 18:42:58 +00:00 - M3.B closed green (authoritative execution)
- Authoritative execution id: `m3b_20260223T184232Z`.
- Result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers `0`, `next_gate=M3.B_READY`.
- Deterministic id outputs:
  - `platform_run_id=platform_20260223T184232Z`
  - `scenario_run_id=scenario_38753050f3b70c666e16f7552016b330`
- Collision probe:
  - checked `evidence/runs/platform_20260223T184232Z/` and found `key_count=0` (no suffix retry needed).
- Determinism proof:
  - scenario derivation recompute check passed.
- Evidence roots:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m3/m3b_20260223T184232Z/`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m3b_20260223T184232Z/`
- Published artifacts:
  - `m3b_run_id_generation_snapshot.json`
  - `m3b_collision_probe_receipts.json`
  - `m3b_run_identity_seed.json`
  - `m3b_execution_summary.json`
  - `m3b_command_receipts.json`

## 2026-02-23 18:53:24 +00:00 - M3.C planning started (digest lane)
- Started planning-only expansion for `M3.C` before execution.
- Rationale:
  - current M3.C section is high-level and not execution-grade,
  - `P1 RUN_PINNED` requires committed `run_config_digest` with mismatch fail-closed handling.
- Planned additions for M3.C:
  - decision pins for canonical payload contract (`json_sorted_keys_v1`, `sha256`, `config_digest`),
  - command-level verification catalog,
  - blocker taxonomy (`M3C-B*`),
  - evidence contract + closure rule,
  - explicit pre-execution planning status.
- Constraint pinned:
  - payload/evidence must be non-secret (no credential materialization).

## 2026-02-23 18:57:12 +00:00 - M3.C planning expanded
- Expanded `M3.C` in `platform.M3.build_plan.md` to execution-grade with:
  - decision pins (canonicalization, digest law, payload composition, secret-safety, immutability, recompute),
  - command-level verification catalog,
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M3C-B1..M3C-B7`),
  - evidence contract and closure rule.
- Updated `platform.build_plan.md` M3 posture to explicitly note M3.C planning expansion.
- No runtime execution in this step; `M3.C` remains execution-pending.

## 2026-02-23 18:56:34 +00:00 - M3.C digest-scope pin before execution
- Detected ambiguity:
  - whether `config_digest` should include run-context fields (`platform_run_id`, `scenario_run_id`) or only canonical config-equivalence inputs.
- Pinned decision:
  - `config_digest` is computed from `digest_input_payload` keys that match `SCENARIO_EQUIVALENCE_KEY_CANONICAL_FIELDS`,
  - run-context fields remain in payload artifact for audit but are excluded from digest bytes,
  - M3.C must assert digest equality against authoritative M3.B `seed_inputs.config_digest`.
- Rationale:
  - preserves deterministic scenario-equivalence contract and avoids per-run digest drift.

## 2026-02-23 18:57:13 +00:00 - M3.C self-reference exclusion pinned
- Detected recursive digest risk:
  - canonical field list includes `config_digest`, which cannot be a direct digest input key.
- Pinned rule:
  - exclude `config_digest` from digest-input bytes (self-reference exclusion),
  - require equality check against authoritative M3.B `seed_inputs.config_digest`.
- This closes a decision hole before M3.C execution.

## 2026-02-23 18:58:48 +00:00 - M3.C attempt #1 blocked on digest-profile drift
- Attempted M3.C execution under `m3c_20260223T185814Z`.
- Outcome:
  - blocker `M3C-B4` raised (`config_digest` mismatch against authoritative M3.B seed digest),
  - recompute determinism itself passed.
- Root cause:
  - M3.C attempt #1 used a digest-input profile different from M3.B seed-generation profile.
- Remediation pin:
  - adopt `m3b_seed_formula_v1` as authoritative M3.C digest profile for this migration baseline,
  - rerun and require digest equality with M3.B seed digest before closure.

## 2026-02-23 19:01:02 +00:00 - M3.C closure green after rerun
- Authoritative run: `m3c_20260223T185958Z`.
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers `0`,
  - `next_gate=M3.C_READY`.
- Digest proof:
  - `config_digest=13f49c0d8e35264a1923844ae19f0e7bdba2b438763b46ae99db6aeeb0b8dc8b`,
  - recompute digest matches exactly,
  - digest equals authoritative M3.B seed digest (`matches_m3b_seed_digest=true`).

## 2026-02-23 19:07:12 +00:00 - M3.D planning started
- Planning-only expansion initiated for `M3.D` (orchestrator-entry + run-lock identity).
- Decision direction pinned:
  - run-lock semantics will be orchestrator-bound (Step Functions execution state per `platform_run_id`),
  - fail-closed on concurrent `RUNNING` execution for same run id,
  - keep `REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID_ENV_KEY` as runtime-scope anchor.
- No runtime execution in this step.

## 2026-02-23 19:08:10 +00:00 - M3.D planning expanded
- Expanded `M3.D` in `platform.M3.build_plan.md` to execution-grade with:
  - decision pins for orchestrator authority, role alignment, runtime-scope env anchor, and run-lock conflict law,
  - command-level verification catalog,
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M3D-B1..M3D-B7`),
  - explicit evidence contract and closure rule.
- Updated `platform.build_plan.md` M3 posture to note M3.D planning expansion.
- No runtime execution in this step; M3.D remains execution-pending.

## 2026-02-23 19:09:08 +00:00 - Roadmap status consistency fix
- Corrected top roadmap statuses in `platform.build_plan.md`:
  - `M2` -> `DONE`
  - `M3` -> `IN_PROGRESS`
- Reason: align summary table with already-recorded phase evidence (`M2` closed; `M3.A..M3.C` closed).

## 2026-02-23 19:10:29 +00:00 - M3.D execution started
- Starting full M3.D execution (orchestrator-entry + run-lock identity readiness).
- Inputs confirmed:
  - `M3.C` PASS artifact present (`m3c_20260223T185958Z`),
  - required M3.D handles pinned in registry.
- Pre-run strategy pinned:
  - resolve Step Functions orchestrator by exact handle name,
  - enforce role alignment against `ROLE_STEP_FUNCTIONS_ORCHESTRATOR`,
  - detect run-lock conflicts via both execution name and execution input `platform_run_id`,
  - fail closed on any durable evidence upload failure.

## 2026-02-23 19:12:25 +00:00 - M3.D attempt #1 blocked; verifier remediating
- Attempt #1 (`m3d_20260223T191145Z`) returned blockers `M3D-B1` and `M3D-B3`.
- Diagnostics show runtime is healthy:
  - state machine resolved and queryable,
  - configured role ARN present,
  - zero running/conflicting executions.
- Root cause:
  - registry parser missed `ROLE_STEP_FUNCTIONS_ORCHESTRATOR` due trailing note text on handle line.
- Remediation:
  - fix parser to accept handle lines with trailing notes,
  - rerun M3.D with same runtime checks and fail-closed posture.

## 2026-02-23 19:14:37 +00:00 - M3.D closure green after rerun
- Authoritative run: `m3d_20260223T191338Z`.
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers `0`,
  - `next_gate=M3.D_READY`.
- Key proofs:
  - state machine resolved and queryable,
  - role alignment passed (`configured_role_arn == ROLE_STEP_FUNCTIONS_ORCHESTRATOR`),
  - run-lock conflict check passed (`running=0`, `conflicts=0`).

## 2026-02-23 22:29:14 +00:00 - M3.E planning started
- Began planning-only expansion for `M3.E` (durable run evidence publication).
- Planning focus pinned:
  - source-of-truth artifact wiring from M3.B/M3.C/M3.D,
  - write-once guard semantics for `run.json` and `run_header.json`,
  - readback/integrity proof requirements before closure.
- No runtime execution in this step.

## 2026-02-23 22:30:05 +00:00 - M3.E planning expanded
- Expanded `M3.E` in `platform.M3.build_plan.md` to execution-grade with:
  - decision pins for write-once publication and readback integrity,
  - command-level verification catalog,
  - fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M3E-B1..M3E-B8`),
  - explicit evidence contract and closure rule.
- Updated `platform.build_plan.md` M3 posture to include M3.E planning expansion.
- No runtime execution in this step; M3.E remains execution-pending.

## 2026-02-23 22:33:00 +00:00 - M3.E execution started
- Beginning full M3.E execution.
- Prechecks confirmed:
  - M3.B/M3.C/M3.D source artifacts are present and green,
  - run evidence prefix `evidence/runs/platform_20260223T184232Z/` currently has no objects.
- Next steps pinned:
  - key-level write-once guard checks (`head-object`),
  - publish `run.json` and `run_header.json`,
  - readback SHA256 verification,
  - emit M3.E receipts and summary.

## 2026-02-23 22:35:27 +00:00 - M3.E closure green
- Authoritative run: `m3e_20260223T223411Z`.

  - `evidence/runs/platform_20260223T184232Z/run_pin/run_header.json`
- Write-once/readback posture:
  - pre-write `head-object` returned 404 for both targets (treated as expected non-existence),
  - both uploads succeeded,
  - readback SHA256 matched local files for both artifacts.

## 2026-02-23 19:16:40 +00:00 - 5B upstream reopen U1.C1 bounded lane executed and rejected
- Executed user-directed bounded upstream reopen candidate on `5B`:
  - authority run-id: `65bd3b8fde7f467f8abaee6a5516ee75` (seed `7`).
- Upstream repair work required before scoring:
  - rebuilt `2A.S4->S5` to produce a clean seed-7 `validation_bundle_2A`,
  - reran `3B.S0->S5`,
  - rebuilt `2B` seed-7 owner surfaces (`S0->S4`, `S7`, `S8`) so `5B.S0` sealed-input and `2B` digest gates were coherent.
- Candidate execution closure:
  - reran `5B.S0`, `5B.S4`, `5B.S5` successfully on the same run-id.
- Scoring artifacts (isolated out-root):
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/p6u1_c1_65bd/segment5b_p1_realism_gateboard_65bd3b8fde7f467f8abaee6a5516ee75.json`

- Result summary:
  - hard rails pass,
  - `T6` improves (`-0.6103 pp` vs baseline) but remains B+ red,
  - `T7` regresses to `10.5238%` (B red; `+6.8196 pp` vs baseline).
- Decision:
  - `HOLD_U1_REJECTED` for candidate `U1.C1`,
  - retain frozen segment posture `SEG5B_RETAIN_PASS_B` (no fanout for this candidate).

## 2026-02-23 22:35:10 +00:00 - 5B freeze directive executed (PASS_B)
