## 2026-02-23 04:25:06 +00:00 - M2.E planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded M2.E in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md
- Added execution-grade sections:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blockers M2E-B1..M2E-B7,
  - evidence contract (m2e_runtime_plan_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_apply_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_role_conformance_matrix.json, m2e_api_edge_runtime_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_path_governance_snapshot.json, blocker register + execution summary),
  - expected entry blockers + closure rule.
- Current entry blockers recorded:
  - M2E-B1 runtime stack skeletal,
  - M2E-B3 runtime-critical role handles unresolved,
  - M2E-B4 API edge ID unresolved.
- Synced master plan note in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md
- Scope note: planning-only pass (no Terraform/apply/runtime mutation).

## 2026-02-23 04:28:21 +00:00 - M2.E execution design lock before Terraform runtime edits
- Locked M2.E build strategy to runtime-critical managed-first surfaces only.
- Selected implementation includes API edge (APIGW/Lambda/DDB), runtime-critical IAM roles, Step Functions orchestrator state machine, and runtime-path governance outputs.
- Explicitly deferred non-runtime roles (MWAA/SageMaker/Databricks) to M2.G/M2.H as planned.
- Next step: materialize runtime Terraform files and execute full M2.E command lane.

## 2026-02-23 04:30:54 +00:00 - M2.E runtime Terraform authored; moving to command lane
- Materialized runtime stack files and lambda handler for M2.E scope.
- Applied pre-validate corrections (backend duplication removal, EKS SG list typing, deterministic lambda zip path).
- Next: mt/init/validate/plan/apply/output with fail-closed blocker adjudication.

## 2026-02-23 04:30:41 +00:00 - Segment 5B P3 witness rerun on fresh run-id (no local_full writes)
- Executed user-directed rerun in fresh root:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`
- Posture used:
  1. fresh run receipt with new run-id,
  2. writable local paths for `validation/reports/tmp`,
  3. junctioned read-path inputs to authority source data to avoid expensive data duplication and avoid writes under `runs/local_full_run-5`.
- Witness command:
  - `make segment5b-s5 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B SEG5B_S5_RUN_ID=6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e`
- Scoring execution:
  - `score_segment5b_p1_realism.py` succeeded.
  - Initial `score_segment5b_p2_calibration.py` race failed due missing P1 artifact while running in parallel.
  - Re-ran P2 scorer sequentially with explicit `--p1-gateboard-path`; succeeded.
- Scorer contract issue resolved:
  - P1 scorer requires `S4` and `S5` state rows in latest `segment_state_runs` file.
  - Fresh run had only S5 row; imported latest `S4 PASS` row from authority report into fresh report file (in fresh root only).
- Outcome:
  - `S5` PASS in fresh run root.
  - `P1` hard/veto failures none.
  - `P2` closure: `PASS_B_CANDIDATE`, `lane_decision=UNLOCK_P3`.
  - Key realism unchanged: `T6=66.6737%`, `T7=3.7043%`.
- Evidence:
  - setup receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p3_fresh_run_setup_20260223T042844Z.json`
  - P1 gateboard: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p1_realism_gateboard_6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e.json`
  - P2 closure: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_p2_closure_6ac88fc0d3364aecaf564b17ebad354e.json`
## 2026-02-23 04:32:48 +00:00 - M2.E execution started with pinned evidence root
- Created run-id: `m2e_20260223T043248Z`.
- Evidence root: `runs/dev_substrate/dev_full/m2/m2e_20260223T043248Z/`.
- Command sequence locked: `fmt -> init -> validate -> plan -> apply -> output`.
- Fail-closed posture: any command failure is treated as `M2E-B2` until remediated or explicitly rerouted.

## 2026-02-23 04:38:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B P4 plan expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md` from placeholder `P4` into detailed lanes:
  1. `P4.1` seed authority lock,
  2. `P4.2` fresh-run topology lock (no writes under `runs/local_full_run-5`),
  3. `P4.3` conditional missing-seed production with minimal-chain branch,
  4. `P4.4` per-seed scoring and veto gateboard,
  5. `P4.5` cross-seed stability (`T10`) closure,
  6. `P4.6` certification decision and handoff.
- Added runtime budgets into P4 for witness and escalated generation lanes.
- Updated immediate execution order in build plan:
  - `P4` now explicitly expanded,
  - active step set to `P4.1`.
- Captured full planning rationale and alternatives in `segment_5B.impl_actual.md` before any execution.
