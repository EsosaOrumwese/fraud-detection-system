## 2026-02-23 04:25:06 +00:00 - M2.E planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded M2.E in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M2.build_plan.md
- Added execution-grade sections:
  - decision-completeness precheck,
  - command surface,
  - fail-closed blockers M2E-B1..M2E-B7,
  - evidence contract (m2e_runtime_plan_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_apply_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_role_conformance_matrix.json, m2e_api_edge_runtime_snapshot.json, m2e_runtime_path_governance_snapshot.json, blocker register + execution summary),
  - expected entry blockers + closure rule.
- Current entry blockers recorded:
  - M2E-B1 runtime stack skeletal,
  - M2E-B3 runtime-critical role handles unresolved,
  - M2E-B4 API edge ID unresolved.
- Synced master plan note in:
  - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md
- Scope note: planning-only pass (no Terraform/apply/runtime mutation).
