## 2026-02-21 02:06:41 +00:00 - 5A POPT.2 planned to execution-grade (S4 hotspot)
- Expanded `POPT.2` in `segment_5A.build_plan.md` from placeholder to bounded subphases:
  - `POPT.2.1` scorer/equivalence contract,
  - `POPT.2.2` S4 lane instrumentation + hotspot reconfirm,
  - `POPT.2.3` input validation/load-path optimization,
  - `POPT.2.4` overlay compute + mapping optimization,
  - `POPT.2.5` witness rerun + closure scoring,
  - `POPT.2.6` closure/handoff/prune sync.
- Pinned post-POPT.1 baseline authority for POPT.2 planning:
  - run-id `ce57da0ead0d4404a5725ca3f4b6e3be`,
  - `S4 wall=456.687s`.
- Pinned quantified closure gate:
  - `S4 <= 360.0s` OR `>=20%` reduction vs active baseline (`<=365.350s`).
- Pinned structural veto rails:
  - stable S4 counters (`domain/event/horizon/overlay/scenario`),
  - no error surface,
  - warning rails non-regression,
  - downstream `S4->S5 PASS`.
- Rerun/prune posture:
  - S4 edits rerun `S4->S5`,
  - S5 support edits rerun `S5` and re-score,
  - prune superseded failed candidate run folders before expensive reruns.
- Phase status sync:
  - `POPT` now recorded as `POPT.0 + POPT.1 closed; POPT.2 expanded/planned on S4, execution pending`.

## 2026-02-21 02:09:23 +00:00 - M10.F bounded rerun started (B1/B5/B8-only)
- USER directive: rerun M10.F with bounded plan focused only on clearing blockers M10F-B1, M10F-B5, M10F-B8 before any M10.G progression.
- Execution id pinned: m10_20260221T020923Z.
- Bounded rerun contract:
  1. B5: use IG Postgres eceipts window counts as authoritative attempt-scoped source (no run_report delta basis).
  2. B8: enforce runtime budget guard by hard stop policy (target window >=15m and <=90m, operator cap ~16-20m for this attempt).
  3. B1: compute multiplier from window ADMIT/min against M10.E baseline (418.66295264623955 admits/min), plus admit-ratio gate (>=0.995).
- Non-goals in this rerun: no new lane scope, no M10.G progression, no unrelated infra changes.
