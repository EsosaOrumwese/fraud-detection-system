* 10:14AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to harden `dev_substrate` Oracle Store planning for Phase `3.C.1`.
  - User direction captured:
    - Oracle Store in `dev_substrate` must be non-local (managed substrate only).
  - Logged decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Planned implementation:
    - rewrite `dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md` into strict managed-substrate gates,
    - index Oracle component implementation map in dev_substrate README.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:15AM
  - Applied Oracle Store plan hardening for `dev_substrate` Phase `3.C.1`.
  - Replaced:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
  - Result:
    - Oracle migration plan is now managed-substrate-only with explicit fail-closed gates (`O1..O8`) and mandatory run/operate + obs/gov + cost/security closure checks before matrix acceptance.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.
