* 10:14AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to harden `dev_substrate` Oracle Store planning for Phase `3.C.1`.
  - User direction captured:
    - Oracle Store in `dev_substrate` must be non-local (managed substrate only).
  - Logged decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Planned implementation:
    - rewrite `dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md` into strict managed-substrate gates,
    - index Oracle component implementation map in dev_substrate README.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:15AM
  - Applied Oracle Store plan hardening for `dev_substrate` Phase `3.C.1`.
  - Replaced:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
  - Result:
    - Oracle migration plan is now managed-substrate-only with explicit fail-closed gates (`O1..O8`) and mandatory run/operate + obs/gov + cost/security closure checks before matrix acceptance.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:46AM
  - Applied Oracle posture correction in planning docs after USER clarification.
  - Corrected ownership expectation:
    - Oracle artifacts are Data Engine-owned truth; platform is consumer with fail-closed authority checks.
  - Updated files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planning result:
    - O1 now models source->destination managed landing sync/backfill, explicit root/scenario pinning, and destination-side authority validation.
    - Platform `3.C.1` now allows component build work during sync but blocks integrated acceptance until Oracle gate is fully green.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:51AM
  - Opened planning lock to carry local-parity stream-sort contract into dev_substrate Oracle planning.
  - USER requirement captured:
    - sorted stream-view data is the runtime input contract and must be explicit in build plans.
  - Planned updates:
    - extend Oracle `O1` plan with per-output stream-sort requirements, receipt/manifest evidence, and fail-closed partial-state handling,
    - extend platform `3.C.1` checks/stop conditions to include sorted stream-view closure.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:53AM
  - Applied stream-sort contract updates to dev_substrate planning.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planning outcome:
    - Oracle O1 now explicitly includes per-output sorted stream-view closure (`ts_utc` contract + deterministic tie-breakers + non-`ts_utc` fallback-key policy),
    - per-output manifest/receipt integrity is mandatory,
    - landing sync without sorted stream-view closure no longer qualifies as `3.C.1` green.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:54AM
  - Added corrective precision to Oracle O1 stream-sort checklist:
    - required output-id sets must be pinned from policy refs before sort execution.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 11:00AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to set missing Oracle env pins in `.env.dev_min` for Phase `3.C.1` kickoff.
  - Planned values include:
    - managed object-store bucket,
    - Oracle root/engine-run root,
    - scenario pin,
    - stream-view root,
    - local sync source.
  - Validation before edit:
    - local sync source path exists.
  - Cost posture:
    - local config edit only; no paid services touched.

* 11:08AM
  - Opened execution lock to retry Oracle `3.C.1` now that network is restored.
  - Planned run:
    - AWS identity check,
    - destination bucket reachability check,
    - Oracle landing sync,
    - stream-sort closure,
    - strict Oracle validation.
  - Cost posture (pre-action):
    - paid surfaces: AWS S3 API/storage.

* 11:21AM
  - Oracle landing sync attempt was interrupted by USER during execution.
  - Post-abort check found active `aws` sync process (`PID 9848`) still running.
  - Process was force-stopped immediately; confirmed no `aws` process remains.
  - Cost posture decision:
    - `TURN OFF NOW` for this attempt (no background transfer left running).

* 11:24AM
  - Opened execution lock for user-directed cleanup of `DEV_MIN_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET` before manual Oracle sync/sort rerun.
  - Planned action:
    - load `.env.dev_min`,
    - clear bucket contents,
    - verify empty state,
    - provide ordered user-run sync/sort commands.
  - Cost posture (pre-action):
    - paid surface: AWS S3 delete/list/head API calls.

* 11:25AM
  - Cleanup correction opened:
    - bucket versioning is enabled, so recursive object delete left historical versions/delete markers.
  - Planned action:
    - perform full version purge (versions + delete markers) to achieve truly empty bucket state.
  - Cost posture (pre-action):
    - paid surface: additional S3 version list/delete API calls.

* 11:34AM
  - Versioned cleanup confirmed complete for `DEV_MIN_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET`.
  - Why it took time:
    - bucket versioning required deleting versions + delete markers, not only current objects.
  - Final verified state:
    - current objects: `0`,
    - versions: `0`,
    - delete markers: `0`.
  - Runtime posture:
    - no active `aws` cleanup process remains.
  - Cost posture:
    - `TURN OFF NOW` (no ongoing paid cleanup operation).

* 11:59AM
  - Completed read-only orientation requested by USER:
    - reviewed local-parity baseline implementation maps (platform-wide closure + active migration surface components: SR, WSP, IG, EB, Oracle Store),
    - then reviewed `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`.
  - Outcome:
    - pinned understanding established for migration from local-parity baseline to `dev_min` managed-substrate posture without semantic drift.
  - Files modified:
    - none (analysis-only pass).
  - Cost posture:
    - docs/read-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 12:08PM
  - Opened pre-change implementation lock for Oracle `3.C.1` operator framework.
  - User-directed scope:
    - build runnable framework for user-operated sync to managed bucket with live terminal progress,
    - then run stream-sort closure,
    - then run strict Oracle authority validation.
  - Planned implementation surfaces:
    - new script: `scripts/dev_substrate/phase3c1_oracle_authority_lock.py`,
    - Make targets for `preflight/sync/stream-sort/validate/run`,
    - fail-closed evidence emission under dev_substrate phase-3 output root.
  - Cost posture:
    - coding/docs only in this step; no paid services touched.

* 12:13PM
  - Applied Oracle `3.C.1` operator framework implementation.
  - Added:
    - `scripts/dev_substrate/phase3c1_oracle_authority_lock.py`
      - subcommands: `preflight`, `sync`, `stream-sort`, `validate`, `run`.
  - Updated:
    - `Makefile`
      - new targets: `platform-dev-min-phase3c1-{preflight,sync,stream-sort,validate,run}`,
      - new tunables: `DEV_MIN_PHASE3C1_*`.
  - Validation executed:
    - `python -m py_compile scripts/dev_substrate/phase3c1_oracle_authority_lock.py` (`PASS`),
    - script help + explicit preflight dry run (`PASS`),
    - `make -n` render checks for all new phase3c1 targets (`PASS`),
    - `make platform-dev-min-phase3c1-preflight DEV_MIN_PHASE3C1_SKIP_AWS_HEAD=1` (`PASS`).
  - Cost posture:
    - no paid sync/sort run executed in this implementation pass.

* 12:13PM
  - Opened pre-change lock to create a fresh incremental migration narrative doc for dev_substrate planning.
  - User direction captured:
    - avoid top-view “fully finished platform” framing,
    - keep planning incremental and append sections progressively from local-parity baseline forward.
  - Planned files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_min_migration_narrative.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md` (index update)
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 12:16PM
  - Applied fresh incremental migration narrative scaffold for ongoing discussion-led planning.
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_min_migration_narrative.md`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md` (active maps index).
  - Outcome:
    - migration narrative now starts from an intentionally minimal scaffold and will be expanded section-by-section as we discuss.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 12:25PM
  - Opened pre-change lock to append first substantive prose section into the new dev-substrate migration narrative.
  - User-directed scope:
    - capture the first flow step as trust/control bootstrap before tool/service swaps.
  - Planned file:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_min_migration_narrative.md`
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 12:27PM
  - Appended Section 1 into the dev-substrate migration prose narrative.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_min_migration_narrative.md`
  - Section title:
    - `Section 1: Bootstrap Before Swap (Flow Step 1)`
  - Section outcome:
    - migration sequence now explicitly starts with trust/control bootstrap and meta-layer-first onboarding before incremental plane swaps.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.
