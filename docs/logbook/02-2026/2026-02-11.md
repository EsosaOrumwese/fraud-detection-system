* 10:14AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to harden `dev_substrate` Oracle Store planning for Phase `3.C.1`.
  - User direction captured:
    - Oracle Store in `dev_substrate` must be non-local (managed substrate only).
  - Logged decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Planned implementation:
    - rewrite `dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md` into strict managed-substrate gates,
    - index Oracle component implementation map in dev_substrate README.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:15AM
  - Applied Oracle Store plan hardening for `dev_substrate` Phase `3.C.1`.
  - Replaced:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
  - Result:
    - Oracle migration plan is now managed-substrate-only with explicit fail-closed gates (`O1..O8`) and mandatory run/operate + obs/gov + cost/security closure checks before matrix acceptance.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:46AM
  - Applied Oracle posture correction in planning docs after USER clarification.
  - Corrected ownership expectation:
    - Oracle artifacts are Data Engine-owned truth; platform is consumer with fail-closed authority checks.
  - Updated files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planning result:
    - O1 now models source->destination managed landing sync/backfill, explicit root/scenario pinning, and destination-side authority validation.
    - Platform `3.C.1` now allows component build work during sync but blocks integrated acceptance until Oracle gate is fully green.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:51AM
  - Opened planning lock to carry local-parity stream-sort contract into dev_substrate Oracle planning.
  - USER requirement captured:
    - sorted stream-view data is the runtime input contract and must be explicit in build plans.
  - Planned updates:
    - extend Oracle `O1` plan with per-output stream-sort requirements, receipt/manifest evidence, and fail-closed partial-state handling,
    - extend platform `3.C.1` checks/stop conditions to include sorted stream-view closure.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:53AM
  - Applied stream-sort contract updates to dev_substrate planning.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planning outcome:
    - Oracle O1 now explicitly includes per-output sorted stream-view closure (`ts_utc` contract + deterministic tie-breakers + non-`ts_utc` fallback-key policy),
    - per-output manifest/receipt integrity is mandatory,
    - landing sync without sorted stream-view closure no longer qualifies as `3.C.1` green.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 10:54AM
  - Added corrective precision to Oracle O1 stream-sort checklist:
    - required output-id sets must be pinned from policy refs before sort execution.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/oracle_store.impl_actual.md`
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 11:00AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to set missing Oracle env pins in `.env.dev_min` for Phase `3.C.1` kickoff.
  - Planned values include:
    - managed object-store bucket,
    - Oracle root/engine-run root,
    - scenario pin,
    - stream-view root,
    - local sync source.
  - Validation before edit:
    - local sync source path exists.
  - Cost posture:
    - local config edit only; no paid services touched.

* 11:08AM
  - Opened execution lock to retry Oracle `3.C.1` now that network is restored.
  - Planned run:
    - AWS identity check,
    - destination bucket reachability check,
    - Oracle landing sync,
    - stream-sort closure,
    - strict Oracle validation.
  - Cost posture (pre-action):
    - paid surfaces: AWS S3 API/storage.
