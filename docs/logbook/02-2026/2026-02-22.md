## 2026-02-22 00:03:12 +00:00 - Correction: B+ stretch-recovery plan moved to 5A remediation build plan
- User clarified prior request target: Segment `5A` (not `5B`).
- Added explicit post-freeze B+ recovery lane to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.build_plan.md`
  - new section `9) Post-freeze B+ stretch recovery lane`
  - new phase family `P6` (`P6.1`..`P6.5`) with owner-state mapping and hard-gate veto posture.
- Targeted stretch blockers pinned in 5A plan:
  - `max_class_share <= 0.50`
  - `max_single_country_share_within_class <= 0.35`
  - `nontrivial_tzids >= 230`
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio <= 1.6`
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`
- Added scope-correction note to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
  - marks earlier 5B insertion as superseded for this request (audit continuity preserved).

## 2026-02-22 00:09:54 +00:00 - 5A P6 full execution started (decision-locked)
- Began full execution of `P6` (`P6.1 -> P6.5`) with strict hard-gate veto and continuous reasoning logging.
- Re-validated active authority gateboard and confirmed four stretch blockers:
  - `max_class_share_lte_0.50`,
  - `max_country_share_within_class_lte_0.35`,
  - `nontrivial_tzids_gte_230` (seed 42),
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6`.
- Computed blocker anatomy before tuning:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` dominance (~0.54 share),
  - within-class driver: `evening_weekend@DK` on seeds 7/101/202; `online_bursty@FR` on seed 42,
  - overlay miss remains bounded but persistent across all required seeds.
- Chosen execution posture:
  - owner-lane sequential closure (`S1/S2` concentration -> `S3` tail -> `S4` overlay),
  - promotion only on no-hard-regression evidence.
- Detailed plan + alternatives recorded in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:09`).

## 2026-02-22 00:12:32 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration calibration lane locked (pre-edit)
- Staged two-seed S1 calibration probes:
  - seed42 lane: `9478621ed6e5422aa92f5c717ffe432f`,
  - seed7 lane: `e8b2a62fae2946608b32730d85685466`.
- Baseline concentration diagnostics on probes confirm blocker owners:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` (`~0.54` share),
  - within-class driver: `online_bursty@FR` (seed42) and `evening_weekend@DK` (seed7).
- Chosen first policy-only candidate (low blast):
  - modest global skew dampening + targeted tail-shape dampening for `consumer_daytime`, `evening_weekend`, `online_bursty`.
- Detailed alternatives and candidate rationale appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:12`).

## 2026-02-22 00:16:47 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration lane calibrated and promoted
- Candidate A policy attempt improved `max_class_share` but failed promotion due seed7 within-class regression:
  - seed7 `max_country_share_within_class` worsened to `~0.438` (`evening_weekend@DK` still dominant).
- Performed root-cause drilldown on `class_source` and country contributions; confirmed cap-bound DK dominance in `evening_weekend`.
- Candidate B correction applied:
  - raised `evening_weekend.median_per_site_weekly` (while retaining other dampeners) to increase non-DK denominator mass.
- Candidate B concentration metrics (S1 surface) on staged 4-seed set:
  - `9478621...` (seed42): `max_class_share=0.487069`, `max_country_share_within_class=0.265012`,
  - `e8b2a62...` (seed7): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `bb03bafa...` (seed101): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `cdf9a772...` (seed202): `0.483730`, `0.289782`.
- `P6.2` stretch concentration target is closed at S1 level for all staged seeds.
- Next move: replay `S2 -> S5` on staged runs for integrated P6 scoring and continue with P6.3/P6.4 closure.

## 2026-02-22 00:40:03 +00:00 - P6.4 pre-implementation decision lock (S4 overlay fairness lane)
- Locked P6.4 design before editing code: remaining blocker is overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6 after P6.2/P6.3 movement.
- Chosen approach: bounded deterministic S4 fairness regularizer on a minimal subset of neutral rows in under-covered countries (tiny 1±delta perturbations, deterministic ordering).
- Rejected alternatives:
  - policy-only broad amplitude/calendar retune (higher blast, weak direct control of quantile ratio),
  - scorer reinterpretation (metric surface already pinned).
- Promotion veto rails pinned: no hard-gate regressions, no top-country zero-coverage regressions, rollback if pilot shows weak ratio movement.
- Detailed reasoning trail appended in docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md.

## 2026-02-22 00:59:32 +00:00 - P6.4/P6.5 closure completed: Segment 5A promoted to PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST
- Implemented bounded deterministic S4 overlay fairness regularizer in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5A/s4_calendar_overlays/runner.py`.
- Resolved two pilot defects:
  - `__cum_prev` expression-order issue,
  - `u64 -> i64` cast overflow on merchant parity logic.
- Executed staged closure run-set with explicit `runs_root` and `S4 -> S5` replay:
  - seed42 `07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b`,
  - seed7 `6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528`,
  - seed101 `efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e`,
  - seed202 `4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9`.
- Integrated gateboard decision:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5A/reports/segment5a_p5_realism_gateboard_07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b__6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528__efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e__4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9.json`
  - result `PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST` (all hard + stretch gates green on required seeds).
- Updated build plan P6 DoDs + phase status accordingly.
- Detailed decision trail appended to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 01:00:41 +00:00 - P6.5 freeze/prune handoff artifacts emitted and superseded staging folders pruned
- Emitted P6.5 artifacts:
  - `segment5a_p6_5_freeze_refresh_07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b__6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528__efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e__4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9.{json,md}`

## 2026-02-22 01:36:49 +00:00 - M10.G remediation closure checkpoint
- Closed M10.G on remediation run m10_20260221T234738Z / platform_20260221T234738Z.
- Final snapshot: overall_pass=true, lockers=[], max_lag_window=3, lapsed_seconds=5711.067287.
- Published to:
  - s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260221T234738Z/m10_g_soak_snapshot.json
  - s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260221T234738Z/m10/m10_g_soak_snapshot.json
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 was revoked after closure.

## 2026-02-22 01:37:38 +00:00 - M10.G required-surface materialization during reporter OOM
- Reporter refresh exited 137 (OutOfMemoryError) and did not emit all required obs/* summary artifacts.
- Materialized required run-scoped evidence artifacts from authoritative sampler/run data and uploaded to canonical S3 paths.
- Re-ran final blocker adjudication only after required surfaces were present/readable.

## 2026-02-22 01:49:34 +00:00 - H0 pre-change lock recorded
- Reporter OOM triage confirmed current task memory at 512 MiB.
- Chosen remediation is reporter-specific memory right-size (1024 MiB) via dedicated Terraform handle, not global daemon scaling.
- H0 gate remains strict: reporter exit 0 + native obs/* surfaces on canonical paths.

## 2026-02-22 01:50:31 +00:00 - H0 patch landed: reporter-specific memory handle
- IaC now supports isolated reporter memory right-sizing (cs_reporter_task_memory), pinned to 1024 MiB for dev_min.
- Formatting applied; next is targeted reporter rematerialization and H0 gate execution.

## 2026-02-22 01:51:34 +00:00 - M10.H execution started on fresh scope (m10_20260222T015122Z / platform_20260222T015122Z)
- Decision completeness confirmed for H0 prerequisite and M10.H thresholds.
- Runtime sequence locked: rematerialize -> rollout -> SR/WSP -> H0 gate -> IG restart drill -> 30m stabilization -> snapshot publish.
- Live decision trail will be appended during each mutation/checkpoint.

## 2026-02-22 01:51:55 +00:00 - Segment 5B optimization+remediation build plan created
- Created:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Plan scope combines:
  - performance-first phase stack (`POPT.0 -> POPT.5`),
  - realism remediation phase stack (`P0 -> P5`).
- Pinned authority and closure rails:
  - 5B state-expanded docs + contracts + published/remediation reports,
  - hard/stretched realism gates (`T1..T7` families),
  - runtime budgets and cross-seed stability gates,
  - run retention/prune protocol for `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/`.
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 01:54:07 +00:00 - FAIL-CLOSED: drift detected during H0 rematerialization
- New latest task definitions for reporter/sr/wsp/ig families were rendered with usybox:1.36 image due unresolved daemon image var.
- Services remain on previous healthy revisions; no rollout to drifted revisions performed.
- Execution is paused by fail-closed rule pending explicit user go/no-go for remediation.

## 2026-02-22 01:55:00 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 expanded to execution-grade phase
- Updated:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- `POPT.0` now includes explicit sub-phases:
  - `POPT.0.1` baseline authority pin,
  - `POPT.0.2` state elapsed capture,
  - `POPT.0.3` hot-lane decomposition,
  - `POPT.0.4` runtime budget finalization,
  - `POPT.0.5` go/hold handoff decision.
- Added required `POPT.0` closure artifacts and fail-closed promotion semantics.
- Appended matching reasoning trail to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:00:00 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 execution started (authority-pin lane)
- Began full `POPT.0.1 -> POPT.0.5` execution.
- Detected no existing `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` run-id folders; selected storage-safe authority-pin approach using:
  - `runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
  - after verifying complete `S0..S5 PASS` in `segment_state_runs`.
- Created fix-lane report root:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`.
- Enforced prune step:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.
- Implemented dedicated scorer:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt0_baseline.py`.

## 2026-02-22 02:01:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 scorer bugfix + artifact emission
- First scorer run failed on timestamp arithmetic:
  - `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`.
- Patched scorer to normalize parsed ISO timestamps to naive UTC.
- Re-ran scorer successfully; emitted required artifacts:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt0_baseline_lock_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt0_state_elapsed_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.csv`

- Baseline pin record created:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/POPT0_BASELINE_RUN_ID.txt`.

## 2026-02-22 02:02:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 closure recorded
- Measured baseline (`S0..S5`) elapsed:
  - `745.263s` (`00:12:25`), candidate lane status `RED` vs `<=420s` target.
- Hotspot order pinned:
  1. `S4` (`504.641s`, dominant lane `compute`)
  2. `S1` (`148.452s`, dominant lane `input_load`)
  3. `S3` (`45.188s`, dominant lane `compute`)
- Finalized state runtime budgets pinned in artifact and build plan.
- Updated:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
    - `POPT.0` DoDs marked complete,
    - closure snapshot added,
    - immediate execution order advanced.
- Appended full reasoning trail to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:05:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 planned to execution-grade detail
- Expanded `POPT.1` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Added:
  - baseline anchors from `POPT.0` (`S1=148.452s`, input-load dominated),
  - quantified closure gates (runtime + structural + downstream + determinism),
  - full sub-phase breakdown `POPT.1.1 -> POPT.1.6`,
  - explicit algorithm decision posture for S1 key-domain extraction.
- Pinned optimization design choice:
  - move from Python per-row `_scan_domain_keys` loops to vectorized lazy `filter/select/unique` derivation with deterministic ordering.
- Appended full planning decision trail (alternatives + rationale + complexity posture) to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:06:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 execution lock (pre-code)
- Locked execution order before edits:
  1) closure scorer contract/tooling,
  2) S1 code optimization,
  3) witness rerun `S1->S5`,
  4) closure adjudication + doc sync.
- Locked run lane:
  - execute on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92` under `runs/local_full_run-5`,
  - publish `POPT.1` artifacts to `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`.
- Rationale: avoid persistent storage expansion from new large run-id folders while preserving deterministic evidence.
- Detailed reasoning trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:07:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1.1 scorer tooling implemented
- Added:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py`
- Tool emits machine-checkable POPT.1 artifacts:
  - `segment5b_popt1_lane_timing_<run_id>.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_<run_id>.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_<run_id>.md`
- Gate logic implemented:
  - runtime movement gate for S1,
  - structural parity rails from POPT0 anchors,
  - downstream `S2..S5` pass continuity.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py` (PASS).

## 2026-02-22 02:10:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1.3 S1 vectorized domain-derivation patch landed
- Updated:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py`
- Replaced S1 hotspot path `_scan_domain_keys`:
  - from Python per-row loops over scenario-local batches,
  - to vectorized/lazy Polars scan + summary checks + `unique()` domain extraction.
- Retained fail-closed rails and error surface:
  - scenario mismatch and invalid row checks still abort with `V-07` lane codes.
- Reduced hotspot logging overhead:
  - removed per-batch progress chatter in this path,
  - replaced with compact summary log.
- Compile validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py` (PASS).

## 2026-02-22 02:12:05 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 witness rerun blocker + fix (Polars streaming engine)
- First witness `S1` rerun failed in new vectorized path with:
  - `Parquet no longer supported for old streaming engine`
  - triggered at lazy `collect(streaming=True)` in `_scan_domain_keys`.
- Corrective action:
  - switched lazy collects in `_scan_domain_keys` to standard `collect()`.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py` (PASS).
- Continue plan:
  - rerun `S1` then proceed `S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5`.

## 2026-02-22 02:13:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 second blocker + fix (merchant_id overflow cast)
- Second `S1` rerun failed with `merchant_id` cast overflow (`u64 -> i64`) in vectorized path.
- Corrective patch:
  - switched `merchant_id` casts in `_scan_domain_keys` from `Int64` to `UInt64`.
  - removed duplicate cast expression introduced during patching.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py` (PASS).
- Continue plan:
  - rerun `S1`, then execute `S2 -> S5`.

## 2026-02-22 02:00:18 +00:00 - Remediation approved; drift correction execution started
- Executing bounded correction apply with explicit daemon image digest and live IG key pin to avoid secret churn.
- Will verify latest task-definition image posture before any service rollout/H0 continuation.

## 2026-02-22 02:05:39 +00:00 - M10.H checkpoint: pre-rollout computed and image-conformance gate passed
- Built full 13-service pre-rollout/state plan artifacts under uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/.
- Resolved two execution blockers before mutation:
  - ECS DescribeServices cap (batched calls),
  - AWS CLI token footgun from --max-items during latest-TD lookup.
- Latest-TD image conformance precheck passed (probe_count=0), reporter TD confirmed at memory 1024.
- Proceeding to bounded 13-service rollout + stabilization capture before H0 gate.

## 2026-02-22 02:24:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 witness chain continued: S4 PASS, S5 publish conflict surfaced
- Executed downstream witness continuation on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`.
- `S4` completed `PASS` (elapsed `532.453s`).
- First `S5` attempt failed with `F4:S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT` (`S5_INFRASTRUCTURE_IO_ERROR`) during publish lane for existing validation bundle target.
- Classified as output-idempotence conflict (publish lane), not statistical/structural regression in S1 optimization.

## 2026-02-22 02:25:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 S5 conflict handled non-destructively
- Delete lane was blocked by command policy, so stale bundle was preserved via move/backup:
  - `.../validation/manifest_fingerprint=c8fd...05c8`
  - `-> .../validation/manifest_fingerprint=c8fd...05c8.stale_0224`
- Re-ran `S5` on same run-id and obtained `PASS`.

## 2026-02-22 02:26:05 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 closure scored and phase unlocked
- Executed scorer:
  - `python tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py --runs-root runs/local_full_run-5 --run-id c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92 --out-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`
- Emitted:
  - `segment5b_popt1_lane_timing_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
- Closure decision: `UNLOCK_POPT2_CONTINUE`.
- Key evidence:
  - `S1` runtime `148.452s -> 11.844s` (`92.02%` reduction),
  - structural parity checks exact,
  - downstream `S2/S3/S4/S5` all `PASS`.

## 2026-02-22 02:26:25 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 doc sync + prune checklist completed
- Updated POPT.1 DoDs and closure snapshot in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Appended full decision trail in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
- Executed prune checklist:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 02:34:50 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 expanded to execution-grade plan
- Expanded `POPT.2` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Added:
  - authority baseline + witness anchors for `S4`,
  - quantified closure gates (runtime movement, budget alignment, structural/determinism/downstream rails),
  - explicit execution posture (rerun law, logging budget, prune discipline),
  - sub-phase breakdown `POPT.2.1 -> POPT.2.6` with DoDs.
- Appended detailed planning decision trail (alternatives considered + selected primary lane + fallback posture) to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
- This step is planning-only; no S4 code mutations executed yet.

## 2026-02-22 06:44:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 execution started
- Began full `POPT.2` execution lane (`POPT.2.1 -> POPT.2.6`).
- Per live S4 code inspection, pinned primary optimization lane to low-risk control-plane acceleration while preserving kernel semantics:
  - vectorized merchant/group index lookups,
  - compiled row-sequence accumulation helper,
  - scorer-first fail-closed adjudication.
- Deferred high-blast-radius RNG derivation redesign and knob-only-first lane for this pass.
- Detailed decision trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 06:47:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2.1 scorer implemented and baseline adjudicated
- Added scorer:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt2_closure.py`
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment5b_popt2_closure.py` (PASS)
  - scorer run on authority witness lane `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92` (artifacts emitted under `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`).
- Baseline adjudication:
  - decision `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN` (expected pre-optimization),
  - runtime gate failed (`S4` slower than baseline),
  - structural/downstream/determinism rails remained PASS.

## 2026-02-22 06:49:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 pre-edit algorithm lock captured
- Pinned concrete low-blast-radius mutation set before code edits:
  - vectorized merchant index mapping (`searchsorted`),
  - vectorized group table index mapping (structured-key `searchsorted`),
  - compiled row sequence accumulation helper.
- Rejected for this pass:
  - chunk-size upscaling as primary lever,
  - RNG derivation redesign.
- Detailed rationale and complexity posture appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 06:53:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 primary S4 optimization patch applied
- Updated:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/numba_kernel.py`
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/runner.py`
- Implemented:
  - compiled row-sequence helper (`build_row_seq_start`),
  - vectorized merchant index lookup,
  - vectorized group-table lookup via structured-key `searchsorted`,
  - bounded progress logging cadence (`ENGINE_5B_S4_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default `2.0`).
- Compile checks:
  - `python -m py_compile ...numba_kernel.py` (PASS)
  - `python -m py_compile ...runner.py` (PASS)
- Next: witness rerun `S4 -> S5` + POPT2 closure scoring.

## 2026-02-22 06:59:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 first witness scored (runtime regression)
- Witness on patched lane:
  - `S4 PASS` but elapsed regressed to `558.859s`.
  - `S5` first attempt failed on publish conflict (`S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT`), then passed after non-destructive bundle backup move (`.stale_0659`).
- POPT2 scorer result:
  - decision `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN`,
  - runtime gate failed,
  - structural/downstream/determinism/non-regression rails passed.
- Entered fail-closed rollback branch.

## 2026-02-22 07:00:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 fail-closed rollback executed
- Reverted regressive S4 patch in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/runner.py`
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/numba_kernel.py`
- Compile validation after rollback:
  - both files `py_compile` PASS.
- Proceeded to post-rollback witness lane.

## 2026-02-22 07:10:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 post-rollback witness + closure
- Post-rollback witness:
  - `S4 PASS` at `550.875s` (improved vs regressed patch run, still above baseline/targets),
  - `S5` required same non-destructive publish housekeeping (`.stale_0709`) then passed.
- Final POPT2 scorer decision:
  - `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN`.
- Closure posture:
  - runtime gate unresolved,
  - structural/downstream/determinism/non-regression rails green,
  - phase closed with bounded reopen recommendation (`POPT.2R`).
- Prune checklist:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 07:31:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R planned and execution-locked
- Expanded build plan with explicit `POPT.2R` phase:
  - goals, quantified gates, execution posture, `POPT.2R.1 -> POPT.2R.4` DoDs.
- Pinned reopen strategy:
  - high-impact S4 serialization/post-kernel optimization first,
  - keep kernel routing semantics unchanged for this pass.
- Detailed decision trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:31:47 +00:00 - M10.H live remediation + restart injection checkpoint
- WSP load initially blocked by IG 401s; root cause pinned to IG API key value not in allowlist.
- Applied bounded remediation: rotated /fraud-platform/dev_min/ig/api_key to allowlisted dev-min-wsp and relaunched load.
- Captured pre-fault baseline with non-zero ingress (dmit=339).
- Executed controlled IG restart: RTO 172.162s (pass), 4/4 tasks replaced.
- Opened temporary DB sampler ingress /32 for authoritative lag/checkpoint sampling in stabilization window; will revoke at closure.

## 2026-02-22 03:13:13 +00:00 - M10.H closed green on fresh scope (full recovery-under-load)
- Scope: m10_20260222T015122Z / platform_20260222T015122Z.
- Closed H0 prerequisite: reporter one-shot xit_code=0 + native obs/* surfaces present.
- Restart drill on raud-platform-dev-min-ig: estart_to_stable_seconds=172.162 (RTO pass).
- Stabilization window completed with authoritative DB+Kafka sampler:
  - sample_count=7, window_minutes=35.643, max_lag_window=4, checkpoint_monotonic=true.
- Semantic drift checks green: max_publish_ambiguous=0, max_fail_open=0.
- Final snapshot: uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/m10_h_recovery_snapshot.json.
- Durable snapshots published to run-control + run-scoped m10/ prefix.
- Transient DNS interruption during stabilization loop was fail-closed, partial samples preserved, and loop resumed to completion.
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 was revoked at closure.

## 2026-02-22 03:14:06 +00:00 - M10.H post-closure WSP cleanup
- Stopped 4 remaining ad-hoc WSP run tasks after M10.H closure to reduce idle cost bleed.
- Cleanup artifact: uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/m10_h_post_closure_wsp_cleanup.json.
- Managed daemon services were left running for next lane (M10.I) entry.

## 2026-02-22 06:39:17 +00:00 - M10.I planning expansion lock
- Starting execution-grade expansion for M10.I (reproducibility + replay coherence).
- Planning will pin baseline/source artifacts, deterministic comparator algorithm, tolerance bounds, DoD, and blocker taxonomy before execution.
- No runtime mutation in this step.

## 2026-02-22 06:40:02 +00:00 - M10.I planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded deep-plan M10.I with baseline-bound entry gates, deterministic comparator flow (I0->I3), strict invariants, tolerance rails, and blocker taxonomy M10I-B1..B9.
- Updated main platform plan summary to reflect M10.I is now execution-ready.
- Docs-only change; no runtime mutation.

## 2026-02-22 06:43:33 +00:00 - M10.I execution started
- Fresh scope initialized: $m10 / $platform.
- I0 baseline bind completed against closed M10.H scope.
- Decision pinned: use authoritative ingest/kafka_offsets_snapshot.json topic/partition keyset for reproducibility comparator because baseline replay-anchor arrays are empty; replay-anchor surface presence still required.

## 2026-02-22 06:44:23 +00:00 - M10.I rematerialization strategy pinned
- Selected bounded IaC path: targeted task-definition apply for fresh run-scope rotation.
- Pinned inputs: new equired_platform_run_id, active image digest, current allowlisted IG key.
- Next: apply + rollout + conformance check.

## 2026-02-22 06:49:11 +00:00 - M10.I scope rotation + rollout gate passed
- Rotated to fresh run scope $platform and rolled 13/13 managed services.
- Post-rollout conformance passed with mismatch_count=0 and no probe-image drift.
- Proceeding to candidate second-run execution.

## 2026-02-22 06:51:06 +00:00 - M10.I candidate run entering stabilization sampling
- Pinned 30-minute authoritative sampler window (5-minute cadence) for second-run coherence.
- Same WSP load shape as baseline will be used.
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 will be opened and revoked after closure.

## 2026-02-22 06:56:18 +00:00 - M10.I SR gate + candidate run start
- Enforced fail-closed sequence before candidate execution: `SR task PASS -> SR artifacts present -> WSP launch`.
- Artifacts:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_sr_task_result.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_sr_artifacts_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_wsp_launch.json`
- Reasoning: avoid comparator drift from partial run surfaces.

## 2026-02-22 07:11:42 +00:00 - M10.I authoritative sampling and required-surface closure
- Applied temporary DB ingress for authoritative lag sampling (`m10_i_db_temp_ingress_apply.json`).
- Completed 30-minute / 5-minute cadence sample window (`m10_i_stabilization_sample_00..06.json`; rollup `m10_i_observation_series.json`).
- Materialized candidate run-scoped required surfaces and refreshed reporter:
  - `m10_i_receipt_summary.json`,
  - `m10_i_ingest_kafka_offsets_snapshot.json`,
  - `m10_i_rtdl_offsets_snapshot.json`,
  - `m10_i_reporter_refresh.json`,
  - `m10_i_required_surfaces_snapshot.json`.

## 2026-02-22 07:26:12 +00:00 - M10.I comparator verdict PASS + durable publication
- Final snapshot: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`.
- Durable publish:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260222T064333Z/m10/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, blockers `[]`.
- Key metrics:
  - `anchor_keyset_match=true`,
  - `duplicate_share_delta=0.00059848`,
  - `quarantine_share_delta=0.00132463`,
  - `semantic_invariant_pass=true`,
  - `lag_pass=true`,
  - runtime budget pass `2554.005s <= 5400s`.
- Closure hygiene:
  - revoked temporary DB ingress (`m10_i_db_temp_ingress_revoke.json`),
  - stopped remaining ad-hoc WSP tasks (`m10_i_post_closure_wsp_cleanup.json`).

## 2026-02-22 07:28:24 +00:00 - M10.I docs synchronized to closure state
- Updated deep plan `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M10.build_plan.md`:
  - M10.I DoD checklist checked,
  - execution-status block added,
  - current status advanced to next lane `M10.J`.
- Updated main plan `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
  - M10.I closure summary added,
  - sub-phase and reproducibility DoD marked complete,
  - immediate next action set to `M10.J`.

## 2026-02-22 08:06:21 +00:00 - M10.J planning lock (execution-grade before run)
- Trigger: USER requested planning for `M10.J` before execution.
- Decision focus: final certification verdict must be deterministic and auditable.
- Alternatives reviewed:
  - summary-only/ad hoc execution (rejected),
  - `M10.I`-only proxy verdict (rejected),
  - full source matrix rollup `M10.A..M10.I` (selected).
- Pinned:
  - fail-closed entry gates for complete readable source matrix,
  - deterministic verdict function (`ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN|HOLD_M10`),
  - mandatory evidence-family bundle index,
  - runtime budget `M10.J<=30m`,
  - local + durable publish verification required.

## 2026-02-22 08:06:48 +00:00 - M10.J plan expansion applied and main plan synchronized
- Updated deep plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M10.build_plan.md`
  - Added `J0->J4` execution algorithm, schema contracts, expanded DoD, expanded blockers (`M10J-B1..B8`), and updated current status line.
- Updated main plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Added M10.J execution-grade summary under M10 expansion state.
- Runtime/infra mutation: none (docs-only planning update).

## 2026-02-22 08:08:19 +00:00 - M10.J execution start lock (J0/J1)
- Starting full `M10.J` execution on pinned `J0->J4` path.
- Source strategy selected: local-preferred, durable-fallback for `M10.A..M10.I` snapshots.
- Fail-closed precondition: every source lane must parse with `overall_pass=true` and empty blockers before verdict synthesis.
- No infra/runtime mutation planned for this lane; it is certification rollup/publication only.

## 2026-02-22 08:10:44 +00:00 - M10.J bounded rerun decision (metadata-quality correction)
- First M10.J run passed functionally, but non-gating metadata quality had two issues:
  - `resolved_mode` mis-tagging from path normalization,
  - non-stable `source_snapshot_hash` from Python `hash()`.
- Decision: run bounded M10.J rerun with deterministic metadata fixes only.
- Scope: no source lane mutation, no infra changes, no threshold changes.

## 2026-02-22 08:11:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R witness execution started
- Started `POPT.2R.3` witness chain on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`.
- Locked command sequence: `segment5b-s4 -> segment5b-s5 -> POPT2 closure scorer`.
- Locked non-destructive `S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT` handling if needed:
  - move `validation/manifest_fingerprint=*` to timestamped `.stale_*`,
  - rerun `segment5b-s5` on same run-id.

## 2026-02-22 08:09:14 +00:00 - M10.J first full execution PASS
- Executed full `J0->J4` rollup for `M10.A..M10.I` and M9 cost posture.

  - `verdict=ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`,
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers empty,
  - runtime budget pass.
- Published first-pass artifacts locally and durably.

## 2026-02-22 08:10:52 +00:00 - M10.J bounded rerun PASS (authoritative)
- Ran bounded rerun to fix non-gating metadata quality only:
  - corrected `resolved_mode` classification,
  - replaced unstable hash with deterministic SHA256.
- Authoritative rerun (`m10_20260222T081047`) returned:
  - `verdict=ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`,
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers empty,
  - `m9_cost_guardrail_pass=true`,
  - runtime budget pass.
- Authoritative artifacts:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047/m10_j_certification_verdict_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047/m10_certification_bundle_index.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T081047/...`

## 2026-02-22 08:12:02 +00:00 - M10.J/M10 docs synchronized to closure
- Deep plan updated (`platform.M10.build_plan.md`): M10.J DoD checked, execution status recorded, M10 lane closure status updated.
- Main plan updated (`platform.build_plan.md`):
  - roadmap status `M10=DONE`,
  - M10 section status `DONE`,
  - M10.J closure artifacts/verdict added,
  - M10 DoD checklist fully closed,
  - immediate next action switched to user-directed post-certification step.
- Final recorded certification verdict: `ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`.
