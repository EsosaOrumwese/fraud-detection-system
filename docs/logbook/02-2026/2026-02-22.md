## 2026-02-22 00:03:12 +00:00 - Correction: B+ stretch-recovery plan moved to 5A remediation build plan
- User clarified prior request target: Segment `5A` (not `5B`).
- Added explicit post-freeze B+ recovery lane to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.build_plan.md`
  - new section `9) Post-freeze B+ stretch recovery lane`
  - new phase family `P6` (`P6.1`..`P6.5`) with owner-state mapping and hard-gate veto posture.
- Targeted stretch blockers pinned in 5A plan:
  - `max_class_share <= 0.50`
  - `max_single_country_share_within_class <= 0.35`
  - `nontrivial_tzids >= 230`
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio <= 1.6`
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`
- Added scope-correction note to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
  - marks earlier 5B insertion as superseded for this request (audit continuity preserved).

## 2026-02-22 00:09:54 +00:00 - 5A P6 full execution started (decision-locked)
- Began full execution of `P6` (`P6.1 -> P6.5`) with strict hard-gate veto and continuous reasoning logging.
- Re-validated active authority gateboard and confirmed four stretch blockers:
  - `max_class_share_lte_0.50`,
  - `max_country_share_within_class_lte_0.35`,
  - `nontrivial_tzids_gte_230` (seed 42),
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6`.
- Computed blocker anatomy before tuning:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` dominance (~0.54 share),
  - within-class driver: `evening_weekend@DK` on seeds 7/101/202; `online_bursty@FR` on seed 42,
  - overlay miss remains bounded but persistent across all required seeds.
- Chosen execution posture:
  - owner-lane sequential closure (`S1/S2` concentration -> `S3` tail -> `S4` overlay),
  - promotion only on no-hard-regression evidence.
- Detailed plan + alternatives recorded in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:09`).

## 2026-02-22 00:12:32 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration calibration lane locked (pre-edit)
- Staged two-seed S1 calibration probes:
  - seed42 lane: `9478621ed6e5422aa92f5c717ffe432f`,
  - seed7 lane: `e8b2a62fae2946608b32730d85685466`.
- Baseline concentration diagnostics on probes confirm blocker owners:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` (`~0.54` share),
  - within-class driver: `online_bursty@FR` (seed42) and `evening_weekend@DK` (seed7).
- Chosen first policy-only candidate (low blast):
  - modest global skew dampening + targeted tail-shape dampening for `consumer_daytime`, `evening_weekend`, `online_bursty`.
- Detailed alternatives and candidate rationale appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:12`).

## 2026-02-22 00:16:47 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration lane calibrated and promoted
- Candidate A policy attempt improved `max_class_share` but failed promotion due seed7 within-class regression:
  - seed7 `max_country_share_within_class` worsened to `~0.438` (`evening_weekend@DK` still dominant).
- Performed root-cause drilldown on `class_source` and country contributions; confirmed cap-bound DK dominance in `evening_weekend`.
- Candidate B correction applied:
  - raised `evening_weekend.median_per_site_weekly` (while retaining other dampeners) to increase non-DK denominator mass.
- Candidate B concentration metrics (S1 surface) on staged 4-seed set:
  - `9478621...` (seed42): `max_class_share=0.487069`, `max_country_share_within_class=0.265012`,
  - `e8b2a62...` (seed7): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `bb03bafa...` (seed101): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `cdf9a772...` (seed202): `0.483730`, `0.289782`.
- `P6.2` stretch concentration target is closed at S1 level for all staged seeds.
- Next move: replay `S2 -> S5` on staged runs for integrated P6 scoring and continue with P6.3/P6.4 closure.

## 2026-02-22 00:40:03 +00:00 - P6.4 pre-implementation decision lock (S4 overlay fairness lane)
- Locked P6.4 design before editing code: remaining blocker is overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6 after P6.2/P6.3 movement.
- Chosen approach: bounded deterministic S4 fairness regularizer on a minimal subset of neutral rows in under-covered countries (tiny 1±delta perturbations, deterministic ordering).
- Rejected alternatives:
  - policy-only broad amplitude/calendar retune (higher blast, weak direct control of quantile ratio),
  - scorer reinterpretation (metric surface already pinned).
- Promotion veto rails pinned: no hard-gate regressions, no top-country zero-coverage regressions, rollback if pilot shows weak ratio movement.
- Detailed reasoning trail appended in docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md.

## 2026-02-22 00:59:32 +00:00 - P6.4/P6.5 closure completed: Segment 5A promoted to PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST
- Implemented bounded deterministic S4 overlay fairness regularizer in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5A/s4_calendar_overlays/runner.py`.
- Resolved two pilot defects:
  - `__cum_prev` expression-order issue,
  - `u64 -> i64` cast overflow on merchant parity logic.
- Executed staged closure run-set with explicit `runs_root` and `S4 -> S5` replay:
  - seed42 `07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b`,
  - seed7 `6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528`,
  - seed101 `efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e`,
  - seed202 `4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9`.
- Integrated gateboard decision:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5A/reports/segment5a_p5_realism_gateboard_07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b__6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528__efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e__4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9.json`
  - result `PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST` (all hard + stretch gates green on required seeds).
- Updated build plan P6 DoDs + phase status accordingly.
- Detailed decision trail appended to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 01:00:41 +00:00 - P6.5 freeze/prune handoff artifacts emitted and superseded staging folders pruned
- Emitted P6.5 artifacts:
  - `segment5a_p6_5_freeze_refresh_07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b__6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528__efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e__4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9.{json,md}`

## 2026-02-22 01:36:49 +00:00 - M10.G remediation closure checkpoint
- Closed M10.G on remediation run m10_20260221T234738Z / platform_20260221T234738Z.
- Final snapshot: overall_pass=true, lockers=[], max_lag_window=3, lapsed_seconds=5711.067287.
- Published to:
  - s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260221T234738Z/m10_g_soak_snapshot.json
  - s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260221T234738Z/m10/m10_g_soak_snapshot.json
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 was revoked after closure.

## 2026-02-22 01:37:38 +00:00 - M10.G required-surface materialization during reporter OOM
- Reporter refresh exited 137 (OutOfMemoryError) and did not emit all required obs/* summary artifacts.
- Materialized required run-scoped evidence artifacts from authoritative sampler/run data and uploaded to canonical S3 paths.
- Re-ran final blocker adjudication only after required surfaces were present/readable.

## 2026-02-22 01:49:34 +00:00 - H0 pre-change lock recorded
- Reporter OOM triage confirmed current task memory at 512 MiB.
- Chosen remediation is reporter-specific memory right-size (1024 MiB) via dedicated Terraform handle, not global daemon scaling.
- H0 gate remains strict: reporter exit 0 + native obs/* surfaces on canonical paths.

## 2026-02-22 01:50:31 +00:00 - H0 patch landed: reporter-specific memory handle
- IaC now supports isolated reporter memory right-sizing (cs_reporter_task_memory), pinned to 1024 MiB for dev_min.
- Formatting applied; next is targeted reporter rematerialization and H0 gate execution.

## 2026-02-22 01:51:34 +00:00 - M10.H execution started on fresh scope (m10_20260222T015122Z / platform_20260222T015122Z)
- Decision completeness confirmed for H0 prerequisite and M10.H thresholds.
- Runtime sequence locked: rematerialize -> rollout -> SR/WSP -> H0 gate -> IG restart drill -> 30m stabilization -> snapshot publish.
- Live decision trail will be appended during each mutation/checkpoint.

## 2026-02-22 01:51:55 +00:00 - Segment 5B optimization+remediation build plan created
- Created:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Plan scope combines:
  - performance-first phase stack (`POPT.0 -> POPT.5`),
  - realism remediation phase stack (`P0 -> P5`).
- Pinned authority and closure rails:
  - 5B state-expanded docs + contracts + published/remediation reports,
  - hard/stretched realism gates (`T1..T7` families),
  - runtime budgets and cross-seed stability gates,
  - run retention/prune protocol for `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/`.
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 01:54:07 +00:00 - FAIL-CLOSED: drift detected during H0 rematerialization
- New latest task definitions for reporter/sr/wsp/ig families were rendered with usybox:1.36 image due unresolved daemon image var.
- Services remain on previous healthy revisions; no rollout to drifted revisions performed.
- Execution is paused by fail-closed rule pending explicit user go/no-go for remediation.

## 2026-02-22 01:55:00 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 expanded to execution-grade phase
- Updated:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- `POPT.0` now includes explicit sub-phases:
  - `POPT.0.1` baseline authority pin,
  - `POPT.0.2` state elapsed capture,
  - `POPT.0.3` hot-lane decomposition,
  - `POPT.0.4` runtime budget finalization,
  - `POPT.0.5` go/hold handoff decision.
- Added required `POPT.0` closure artifacts and fail-closed promotion semantics.
- Appended matching reasoning trail to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:00:00 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 execution started (authority-pin lane)
- Began full `POPT.0.1 -> POPT.0.5` execution.
- Detected no existing `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` run-id folders; selected storage-safe authority-pin approach using:
  - `runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
  - after verifying complete `S0..S5 PASS` in `segment_state_runs`.
- Created fix-lane report root:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`.
- Enforced prune step:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.
- Implemented dedicated scorer:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt0_baseline.py`.

## 2026-02-22 02:01:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 scorer bugfix + artifact emission
- First scorer run failed on timestamp arithmetic:
  - `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`.
- Patched scorer to normalize parsed ISO timestamps to naive UTC.
- Re-ran scorer successfully; emitted required artifacts:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt0_baseline_lock_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt0_state_elapsed_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.csv`

- Baseline pin record created:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/POPT0_BASELINE_RUN_ID.txt`.

## 2026-02-22 02:02:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.0 closure recorded
- Measured baseline (`S0..S5`) elapsed:
  - `745.263s` (`00:12:25`), candidate lane status `RED` vs `<=420s` target.
- Hotspot order pinned:
  1. `S4` (`504.641s`, dominant lane `compute`)
  2. `S1` (`148.452s`, dominant lane `input_load`)
  3. `S3` (`45.188s`, dominant lane `compute`)
- Finalized state runtime budgets pinned in artifact and build plan.
- Updated:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
    - `POPT.0` DoDs marked complete,
    - closure snapshot added,
    - immediate execution order advanced.
- Appended full reasoning trail to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:05:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 planned to execution-grade detail
- Expanded `POPT.1` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Added:
  - baseline anchors from `POPT.0` (`S1=148.452s`, input-load dominated),
  - quantified closure gates (runtime + structural + downstream + determinism),
  - full sub-phase breakdown `POPT.1.1 -> POPT.1.6`,
  - explicit algorithm decision posture for S1 key-domain extraction.
- Pinned optimization design choice:
  - move from Python per-row `_scan_domain_keys` loops to vectorized lazy `filter/select/unique` derivation with deterministic ordering.
- Appended full planning decision trail (alternatives + rationale + complexity posture) to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:06:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 execution lock (pre-code)
- Locked execution order before edits:
  1) closure scorer contract/tooling,
  2) S1 code optimization,
  3) witness rerun `S1->S5`,
  4) closure adjudication + doc sync.
- Locked run lane:
  - execute on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92` under `runs/local_full_run-5`,
  - publish `POPT.1` artifacts to `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`.
- Rationale: avoid persistent storage expansion from new large run-id folders while preserving deterministic evidence.
- Detailed reasoning trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:07:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1.1 scorer tooling implemented
- Added:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py`
- Tool emits machine-checkable POPT.1 artifacts:
  - `segment5b_popt1_lane_timing_<run_id>.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_<run_id>.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_<run_id>.md`
- Gate logic implemented:
  - runtime movement gate for S1,
  - structural parity rails from POPT0 anchors,
  - downstream `S2..S5` pass continuity.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py` (PASS).

## 2026-02-22 02:10:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1.3 S1 vectorized domain-derivation patch landed
- Updated:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py`
- Replaced S1 hotspot path `_scan_domain_keys`:
  - from Python per-row loops over scenario-local batches,
  - to vectorized/lazy Polars scan + summary checks + `unique()` domain extraction.
- Retained fail-closed rails and error surface:
  - scenario mismatch and invalid row checks still abort with `V-07` lane codes.
- Reduced hotspot logging overhead:
  - removed per-batch progress chatter in this path,
  - replaced with compact summary log.
- Compile validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py` (PASS).

## 2026-02-22 02:12:05 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 witness rerun blocker + fix (Polars streaming engine)
- First witness `S1` rerun failed in new vectorized path with:
  - `Parquet no longer supported for old streaming engine`
  - triggered at lazy `collect(streaming=True)` in `_scan_domain_keys`.
- Corrective action:
  - switched lazy collects in `_scan_domain_keys` to standard `collect()`.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py` (PASS).
- Continue plan:
  - rerun `S1` then proceed `S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5`.

## 2026-02-22 02:13:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 second blocker + fix (merchant_id overflow cast)
- Second `S1` rerun failed with `merchant_id` cast overflow (`u64 -> i64`) in vectorized path.
- Corrective patch:
  - switched `merchant_id` casts in `_scan_domain_keys` from `Int64` to `UInt64`.
  - removed duplicate cast expression introduced during patching.
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s1_time_grid/runner.py` (PASS).
- Continue plan:
  - rerun `S1`, then execute `S2 -> S5`.

## 2026-02-22 02:00:18 +00:00 - Remediation approved; drift correction execution started
- Executing bounded correction apply with explicit daemon image digest and live IG key pin to avoid secret churn.
- Will verify latest task-definition image posture before any service rollout/H0 continuation.

## 2026-02-22 02:05:39 +00:00 - M10.H checkpoint: pre-rollout computed and image-conformance gate passed
- Built full 13-service pre-rollout/state plan artifacts under uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/.
- Resolved two execution blockers before mutation:
  - ECS DescribeServices cap (batched calls),
  - AWS CLI token footgun from --max-items during latest-TD lookup.
- Latest-TD image conformance precheck passed (probe_count=0), reporter TD confirmed at memory 1024.
- Proceeding to bounded 13-service rollout + stabilization capture before H0 gate.

## 2026-02-22 02:24:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 witness chain continued: S4 PASS, S5 publish conflict surfaced
- Executed downstream witness continuation on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`.
- `S4` completed `PASS` (elapsed `532.453s`).
- First `S5` attempt failed with `F4:S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT` (`S5_INFRASTRUCTURE_IO_ERROR`) during publish lane for existing validation bundle target.
- Classified as output-idempotence conflict (publish lane), not statistical/structural regression in S1 optimization.

## 2026-02-22 02:25:15 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 S5 conflict handled non-destructively
- Delete lane was blocked by command policy, so stale bundle was preserved via move/backup:
  - `.../validation/manifest_fingerprint=c8fd...05c8`
  - `-> .../validation/manifest_fingerprint=c8fd...05c8.stale_0224`
- Re-ran `S5` on same run-id and obtained `PASS`.

## 2026-02-22 02:26:05 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 closure scored and phase unlocked
- Executed scorer:
  - `python tools/score_segment5b_popt1_closure.py --runs-root runs/local_full_run-5 --run-id c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92 --out-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`
- Emitted:
  - `segment5b_popt1_lane_timing_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt1_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
- Closure decision: `UNLOCK_POPT2_CONTINUE`.
- Key evidence:
  - `S1` runtime `148.452s -> 11.844s` (`92.02%` reduction),
  - structural parity checks exact,
  - downstream `S2/S3/S4/S5` all `PASS`.

## 2026-02-22 02:26:25 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.1 doc sync + prune checklist completed
- Updated POPT.1 DoDs and closure snapshot in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Appended full decision trail in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
- Executed prune checklist:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 02:34:50 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 expanded to execution-grade plan
- Expanded `POPT.2` in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
- Added:
  - authority baseline + witness anchors for `S4`,
  - quantified closure gates (runtime movement, budget alignment, structural/determinism/downstream rails),
  - explicit execution posture (rerun law, logging budget, prune discipline),
  - sub-phase breakdown `POPT.2.1 -> POPT.2.6` with DoDs.
- Appended detailed planning decision trail (alternatives considered + selected primary lane + fallback posture) to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
- This step is planning-only; no S4 code mutations executed yet.

## 2026-02-22 06:44:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 execution started
- Began full `POPT.2` execution lane (`POPT.2.1 -> POPT.2.6`).
- Per live S4 code inspection, pinned primary optimization lane to low-risk control-plane acceleration while preserving kernel semantics:
  - vectorized merchant/group index lookups,
  - compiled row-sequence accumulation helper,
  - scorer-first fail-closed adjudication.
- Deferred high-blast-radius RNG derivation redesign and knob-only-first lane for this pass.
- Detailed decision trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 06:47:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2.1 scorer implemented and baseline adjudicated
- Added scorer:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt2_closure.py`
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment5b_popt2_closure.py` (PASS)
  - scorer run on authority witness lane `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92` (artifacts emitted under `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports`).
- Baseline adjudication:
  - decision `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN` (expected pre-optimization),
  - runtime gate failed (`S4` slower than baseline),
  - structural/downstream/determinism rails remained PASS.

## 2026-02-22 06:49:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 pre-edit algorithm lock captured
- Pinned concrete low-blast-radius mutation set before code edits:
  - vectorized merchant index mapping (`searchsorted`),
  - vectorized group table index mapping (structured-key `searchsorted`),
  - compiled row sequence accumulation helper.
- Rejected for this pass:
  - chunk-size upscaling as primary lever,
  - RNG derivation redesign.
- Detailed rationale and complexity posture appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 06:53:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 primary S4 optimization patch applied
- Updated:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/numba_kernel.py`
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/runner.py`
- Implemented:
  - compiled row-sequence helper (`build_row_seq_start`),
  - vectorized merchant index lookup,
  - vectorized group-table lookup via structured-key `searchsorted`,
  - bounded progress logging cadence (`ENGINE_5B_S4_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default `2.0`).
- Compile checks:
  - `python -m py_compile ...numba_kernel.py` (PASS)
  - `python -m py_compile ...runner.py` (PASS)
- Next: witness rerun `S4 -> S5` + POPT2 closure scoring.

## 2026-02-22 06:59:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 first witness scored (runtime regression)
- Witness on patched lane:
  - `S4 PASS` but elapsed regressed to `558.859s`.
  - `S5` first attempt failed on publish conflict (`S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT`), then passed after non-destructive bundle backup move (`.stale_0659`).
- POPT2 scorer result:
  - decision `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN`,
  - runtime gate failed,
  - structural/downstream/determinism/non-regression rails passed.
- Entered fail-closed rollback branch.

## 2026-02-22 07:00:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 fail-closed rollback executed
- Reverted regressive S4 patch in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/runner.py`
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/numba_kernel.py`
- Compile validation after rollback:
  - both files `py_compile` PASS.
- Proceeded to post-rollback witness lane.

## 2026-02-22 07:10:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2 post-rollback witness + closure
- Post-rollback witness:
  - `S4 PASS` at `550.875s` (improved vs regressed patch run, still above baseline/targets),
  - `S5` required same non-destructive publish housekeeping (`.stale_0709`) then passed.
- Final POPT2 scorer decision:
  - `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN`.
- Closure posture:
  - runtime gate unresolved,
  - structural/downstream/determinism/non-regression rails green,
  - phase closed with bounded reopen recommendation (`POPT.2R`).
- Prune checklist:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B`
  - result: no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 07:31:10 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R planned and execution-locked
- Expanded build plan with explicit `POPT.2R` phase:
  - goals, quantified gates, execution posture, `POPT.2R.1 -> POPT.2R.4` DoDs.
- Pinned reopen strategy:
  - high-impact S4 serialization/post-kernel optimization first,
  - keep kernel routing semantics unchanged for this pass.
- Detailed decision trail appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-22 02:31:47 +00:00 - M10.H live remediation + restart injection checkpoint
- WSP load initially blocked by IG 401s; root cause pinned to IG API key value not in allowlist.
- Applied bounded remediation: rotated /fraud-platform/dev_min/ig/api_key to allowlisted dev-min-wsp and relaunched load.
- Captured pre-fault baseline with non-zero ingress (dmit=339).
- Executed controlled IG restart: RTO 172.162s (pass), 4/4 tasks replaced.
- Opened temporary DB sampler ingress /32 for authoritative lag/checkpoint sampling in stabilization window; will revoke at closure.

## 2026-02-22 03:13:13 +00:00 - M10.H closed green on fresh scope (full recovery-under-load)
- Scope: m10_20260222T015122Z / platform_20260222T015122Z.
- Closed H0 prerequisite: reporter one-shot xit_code=0 + native obs/* surfaces present.
- Restart drill on raud-platform-dev-min-ig: estart_to_stable_seconds=172.162 (RTO pass).
- Stabilization window completed with authoritative DB+Kafka sampler:
  - sample_count=7, window_minutes=35.643, max_lag_window=4, checkpoint_monotonic=true.
- Semantic drift checks green: max_publish_ambiguous=0, max_fail_open=0.
- Final snapshot: uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/m10_h_recovery_snapshot.json.
- Durable snapshots published to run-control + run-scoped m10/ prefix.
- Transient DNS interruption during stabilization loop was fail-closed, partial samples preserved, and loop resumed to completion.
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 was revoked at closure.

## 2026-02-22 03:14:06 +00:00 - M10.H post-closure WSP cleanup
- Stopped 4 remaining ad-hoc WSP run tasks after M10.H closure to reduce idle cost bleed.
- Cleanup artifact: uns/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T015122Z/m10_h_post_closure_wsp_cleanup.json.
- Managed daemon services were left running for next lane (M10.I) entry.

## 2026-02-22 06:39:17 +00:00 - M10.I planning expansion lock
- Starting execution-grade expansion for M10.I (reproducibility + replay coherence).
- Planning will pin baseline/source artifacts, deterministic comparator algorithm, tolerance bounds, DoD, and blocker taxonomy before execution.
- No runtime mutation in this step.

## 2026-02-22 06:40:02 +00:00 - M10.I planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded deep-plan M10.I with baseline-bound entry gates, deterministic comparator flow (I0->I3), strict invariants, tolerance rails, and blocker taxonomy M10I-B1..B9.
- Updated main platform plan summary to reflect M10.I is now execution-ready.
- Docs-only change; no runtime mutation.

## 2026-02-22 06:43:33 +00:00 - M10.I execution started
- Fresh scope initialized: $m10 / $platform.
- I0 baseline bind completed against closed M10.H scope.
- Decision pinned: use authoritative ingest/kafka_offsets_snapshot.json topic/partition keyset for reproducibility comparator because baseline replay-anchor arrays are empty; replay-anchor surface presence still required.

## 2026-02-22 06:44:23 +00:00 - M10.I rematerialization strategy pinned
- Selected bounded IaC path: targeted task-definition apply for fresh run-scope rotation.
- Pinned inputs: new equired_platform_run_id, active image digest, current allowlisted IG key.
- Next: apply + rollout + conformance check.

## 2026-02-22 06:49:11 +00:00 - M10.I scope rotation + rollout gate passed
- Rotated to fresh run scope $platform and rolled 13/13 managed services.
- Post-rollout conformance passed with mismatch_count=0 and no probe-image drift.
- Proceeding to candidate second-run execution.

## 2026-02-22 06:51:06 +00:00 - M10.I candidate run entering stabilization sampling
- Pinned 30-minute authoritative sampler window (5-minute cadence) for second-run coherence.
- Same WSP load shape as baseline will be used.
- Temporary DB sampler ingress /32 will be opened and revoked after closure.

## 2026-02-22 06:56:18 +00:00 - M10.I SR gate + candidate run start
- Enforced fail-closed sequence before candidate execution: `SR task PASS -> SR artifacts present -> WSP launch`.
- Artifacts:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_sr_task_result.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_sr_artifacts_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_wsp_launch.json`
- Reasoning: avoid comparator drift from partial run surfaces.

## 2026-02-22 07:11:42 +00:00 - M10.I authoritative sampling and required-surface closure
- Applied temporary DB ingress for authoritative lag sampling (`m10_i_db_temp_ingress_apply.json`).
- Completed 30-minute / 5-minute cadence sample window (`m10_i_stabilization_sample_00..06.json`; rollup `m10_i_observation_series.json`).
- Materialized candidate run-scoped required surfaces and refreshed reporter:
  - `m10_i_receipt_summary.json`,
  - `m10_i_ingest_kafka_offsets_snapshot.json`,
  - `m10_i_rtdl_offsets_snapshot.json`,
  - `m10_i_reporter_refresh.json`,
  - `m10_i_required_surfaces_snapshot.json`.

## 2026-02-22 07:26:12 +00:00 - M10.I comparator verdict PASS + durable publication
- Final snapshot: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`.
- Durable publish:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T064333Z/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260222T064333Z/m10/m10_i_reproducibility_snapshot.json`
- Verdict: `overall_pass=true`, blockers `[]`.
- Key metrics:
  - `anchor_keyset_match=true`,
  - `duplicate_share_delta=0.00059848`,
  - `quarantine_share_delta=0.00132463`,
  - `semantic_invariant_pass=true`,
  - `lag_pass=true`,
  - runtime budget pass `2554.005s <= 5400s`.
- Closure hygiene:
  - revoked temporary DB ingress (`m10_i_db_temp_ingress_revoke.json`),
  - stopped remaining ad-hoc WSP tasks (`m10_i_post_closure_wsp_cleanup.json`).

## 2026-02-22 07:28:24 +00:00 - M10.I docs synchronized to closure state
- Updated deep plan `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M10.build_plan.md`:
  - M10.I DoD checklist checked,
  - execution-status block added,
  - current status advanced to next lane `M10.J`.
- Updated main plan `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
  - M10.I closure summary added,
  - sub-phase and reproducibility DoD marked complete,
  - immediate next action set to `M10.J`.

## 2026-02-22 08:06:21 +00:00 - M10.J planning lock (execution-grade before run)
- Trigger: USER requested planning for `M10.J` before execution.
- Decision focus: final certification verdict must be deterministic and auditable.
- Alternatives reviewed:
  - summary-only/ad hoc execution (rejected),
  - `M10.I`-only proxy verdict (rejected),
  - full source matrix rollup `M10.A..M10.I` (selected).
- Pinned:
  - fail-closed entry gates for complete readable source matrix,
  - deterministic verdict function (`ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN|HOLD_M10`),
  - mandatory evidence-family bundle index,
  - runtime budget `M10.J<=30m`,
  - local + durable publish verification required.

## 2026-02-22 08:06:48 +00:00 - M10.J plan expansion applied and main plan synchronized
- Updated deep plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M10.build_plan.md`
  - Added `J0->J4` execution algorithm, schema contracts, expanded DoD, expanded blockers (`M10J-B1..B8`), and updated current status line.
- Updated main plan:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Added M10.J execution-grade summary under M10 expansion state.
- Runtime/infra mutation: none (docs-only planning update).

## 2026-02-22 08:08:19 +00:00 - M10.J execution start lock (J0/J1)
- Starting full `M10.J` execution on pinned `J0->J4` path.
- Source strategy selected: local-preferred, durable-fallback for `M10.A..M10.I` snapshots.
- Fail-closed precondition: every source lane must parse with `overall_pass=true` and empty blockers before verdict synthesis.
- No infra/runtime mutation planned for this lane; it is certification rollup/publication only.

## 2026-02-22 08:10:44 +00:00 - M10.J bounded rerun decision (metadata-quality correction)
- First M10.J run passed functionally, but non-gating metadata quality had two issues:
  - `resolved_mode` mis-tagging from path normalization,
  - non-stable `source_snapshot_hash` from Python `hash()`.
- Decision: run bounded M10.J rerun with deterministic metadata fixes only.
- Scope: no source lane mutation, no infra changes, no threshold changes.

## 2026-02-22 08:11:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R witness execution started
- Started `POPT.2R.3` witness chain on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`.
- Locked command sequence: `segment5b-s4 -> segment5b-s5 -> POPT2 closure scorer`.
- Locked non-destructive `S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT` handling if needed:
  - move `validation/manifest_fingerprint=*` to timestamped `.stale_*`,
  - rerun `segment5b-s5` on same run-id.

## 2026-02-22 08:19:20 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R witness executed (runtime movement achieved)
- `S4` witness completed on authority run-id:
  - `durations.wall_ms=460968` (`460.968s`).
- `S5` first attempt failed with replay publish conflict class:
  - `S5_INFRASTRUCTURE_IO_ERROR` with detail `F4:S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT S5 5B.s5_validation_bundle`.
- Applied non-destructive housekeeping and reran `S5`:
  - moved `validation/manifest_fingerprint=c8fd...05c8` to `.stale_20260222_081902`,
  - rerun `S5` passed with bundle integrity `true`.
- Regenerated closure scorer artifacts:
  - `segment5b_popt2_lane_timing_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt2_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `segment5b_popt2_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`

## 2026-02-22 08:20:05 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.2R closure decision recorded
- Runtime movement vs reopen anchor (`550.875s`) is strong:
  - candidate `460.968s`, improvement `-89.907s` (`-16.32%`).
- `POPT.2R` mandatory gates pass (`<=532.453s` and >=3% improvement); downstream/structural rails pass.
- Noted scorer nuance:
  - `score_segment5b_popt2_closure.py` still emits `HOLD_POPT2_REOPEN` because it enforces legacy POPT2 35% reduction gate.
  - `POPT.2R` phase decision locked in build plan/impl notes as `UNLOCK_POPT3_CONTINUE`.
- Prune hygiene executed:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` -> no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 09:05:12 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3 expanded and execution-locked
- Expanded `POPT.3` to execution-grade in build plan:
  - authority anchors (`S2=47.202s`, `S3=51.750s`),
  - target/stretch gates, guardrails, `POPT.3.1 -> POPT.3.4` DoDs.
- Pinned bounded optimization lane:
  - S2 latent-draw/control-path overhead reduction,
  - S3 per-row Philox/count-loop overhead reduction,
  - no realism/policy tuning and no schema/contract changes.
- Locked rerun protocol for this lane:
  - `segment5b-s2 -> segment5b-s3 -> segment5b-s4 -> segment5b-s5`.

## 2026-02-22 09:07:39 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3 implementation lane applied
- Applied bounded hot-loop optimizations in:
  - `s2_latent_intensity/runner.py`
  - `s3_bucket_counts/runner.py`
- S2 lane:
  - faster Philox draw list materialization + checked counter increment,
  - merged latent/factor computation to reduce intermediate array/list churn.
- S3 lane:
  - fast-path for `blocks_per_row==1` in per-row count loop (inline Philox draw + inline U64->U(0,1)),
  - reduced per-row string overhead via bucket suffix cache and removed redundant casts.
- Safety posture:
  - no policy/schema/contract edits,
  - no realism tuning.
- Compile gate:
  - `python -m py_compile ...s2... ...s3...` passed.

## 2026-02-22 08:09:14 +00:00 - M10.J first full execution PASS
- Executed full `J0->J4` rollup for `M10.A..M10.I` and M9 cost posture.
- First pass (`m10_20260222T080908`) returned:
  - `verdict=ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`,
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers empty,
  - runtime budget pass.
- Published first-pass artifacts locally and durably.

## 2026-02-22 08:10:52 +00:00 - M10.J bounded rerun PASS (authoritative)
- Ran bounded rerun to fix non-gating metadata quality only:
  - corrected `resolved_mode` classification,
  - replaced unstable hash with deterministic SHA256.
- Authoritative rerun (`m10_20260222T081047`) returned:
  - `verdict=ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`,
  - `overall_pass=true`,
  - blockers empty,
  - `m9_cost_guardrail_pass=true`,
  - runtime budget pass.
- Authoritative artifacts:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047/m10_j_certification_verdict_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047/m10_certification_bundle_index.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T081047/...`

## 2026-02-22 08:12:02 +00:00 - M10.J/M10 docs synchronized to closure
- Deep plan updated (`platform.M10.build_plan.md`): M10.J DoD checked, execution status recorded, M10 lane closure status updated.
- Main plan updated (`platform.build_plan.md`):
  - roadmap status `M10=DONE`,
  - M10 section status `DONE`,
  - M10.J closure artifacts/verdict added,
  - M10 DoD checklist fully closed,
  - immediate next action switched to user-directed post-certification step.
- Final recorded certification verdict: `ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`.

## 2026-02-22 08:30:52 +00:00 - Post-certification steps 1/2/3 execution started
- USER-directed sequence accepted:
  1. cost-safe teardown refresh,
  2. freeze certification pack,
  3. closeout docs + wrap-up completion mark.
- Strategy pinned:
  - use managed teardown workflow lane (not local terraform destroy),
  - freeze pack from authoritative M10.J artifacts,
  - add explicit wrap-up note in dev_substrate maps.

## 2026-02-22 08:31:10 +00:00 - Step 1 complete: managed teardown refresh
- Demo teardown run:
  - `run_id=22273463052`
  - `destroy_outcome=success`, `post_destroy_state_resource_count=0`, `overall_pass=true`.
- Confluent teardown run:
  - `run_id=22273580166`
  - `destroy_outcome=success`, `post_destroy_state_resource_count=0`, `overall_pass=true`.
- Snapshot sources downloaded under:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_j_teardown_refresh_demo_artifacts/`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_j_teardown_refresh_confluent_artifacts/`.

## 2026-02-22 08:31:42 +00:00 - Step 2 complete: certification pack frozen
- Produced local freeze artifacts under authoritative execution:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047Z/m10_post_cert_teardown_refresh_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047Z/m10_certified_dev_min_summary.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047Z/m10_certified_dev_min_summary.md`
- Uploaded durable copies to:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T081047Z/...`
- Remediation during freeze:
  - fixed false-fail predicate on `state_count=0` in script logic,
  - republished corrected artifacts with `overall_pass_teardown_refresh=true`.

## 2026-02-22 08:32:05 +00:00 - Step 3 complete: closeout docs + wrap-up marker
- Corrected canonical `...Z` execution-id references in M10 plan docs.
- Added migration wrap-up note:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.migration_wrap_up.md`
- Updated router:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
- Track completion is now explicitly recorded in wrap-up note.

## 2026-02-22 08:33:18 +00:00 - Canonical execution-id normalization
- Corrected plan references to canonical ids with `Z` suffix:
  - `m10_20260222T080908Z`
  - `m10_20260222T081047Z`
- Rationale: local/S3 artifact keys are canonical with `...Z`; earlier no-`Z` mentions were documentation transcription drift.

## 2026-02-22 08:34:14 +00:00 - Added independent residual checks to teardown refresh proof
- Executed post-destroy AWS residual checks:
  - ECS cluster `fraud-platform-dev-min` -> `INACTIVE`, 0 tasks/services.
  - ECS services list -> empty.
  - filtered NAT gateways (`fraud-platform`) -> empty.
  - filtered load balancers (`fraud-platform`) -> empty.
- Updated and republished teardown refresh snapshot:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260222T081047Z/m10_post_cert_teardown_refresh_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260222T081047Z/m10_post_cert_teardown_refresh_snapshot.json`
- Updated and republished freeze summaries with residual-check closure flag.

## 2026-02-22 08:34:57 +00:00 - Migration wrap-up note published
- Added completion note:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.migration_wrap_up.md`
- Updated router:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/README.md`
- Track status now explicitly marked complete.

## 2026-02-22 09:12:04 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3 corrective rollback repair before witness
- Detected newline corruption in:
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s2_latent_intensity/runner.py`
  - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s3_bucket_counts/runner.py`
- Corrective action:
  - restored both files from `HEAD`,
  - compile gate re-run (`python -m py_compile ...s2... ...s3...`) passed.
- Reason:
  - witness/closure evidence must be produced on valid source state only.

## 2026-02-22 09:31:40 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3 full execution + closure recorded
- Executed full witness chain on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`:
  - `S2 PASS` (`wall_ms=48516`),

## 2026-02-22 12:03:18 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3R.0 profile lock completed
- Executed profiling-only `POPT.3R.0` on authority run evidence (no code/policy/schema edits).
- Parsed latest `S2/S3` windows from:
  - `runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92/run_log_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.log`
- Measured top cost centers:
  - `S2`: `realised_join_transform_write_loop=25.193s (51.93%)`, `latent_draw_compute=22.117s (45.59%)`.
  - `S3`: `bucket_count_compute_loop=48.604s (94.42%)`, `publish_finalize=2.234s (4.34%)`.

## 2026-02-22 12:10:32 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3R pre-edit decision lock (R1/R2)
- Added explicit pre-edit reasoning entry to `segment_5B.impl_actual.md` before code changes.
- Locked bounded algorithmic lane:
  - `S2`: vectorized latent generation + reduced realised-loop expression overhead.
  - `S3`: fast path for `blocks_per_row==1` + reduced domain-key/per-row dispatch overhead.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - worker/inflight knob scaling,
  - validation relaxation,
  - RNG model redesign.
- Fail-closed posture pinned:
  - compile + state witness after each state patch,
  - rollback regressive state patch before advancing.

## 2026-02-22 12:26:11 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3R.1 S2 iteration checkpoint
- Applied bounded S2 optimization set (latent vectorization + realised-loop scan consolidation).
- Compile gate passed.
- Witnesses recorded:
  - `52.34s` (first candidate run, treated as potential noisy outlier),
  - `48.16s` confirm rerun,
  - `48.17s` after realised-loop consolidation.
- Decision:
  - keep S2 patch set (repeat runs show no sustained regression),
  - S2 stretch gate still not met (`>45s`), carry to final phase adjudication.
- Next step:
  - execute `POPT.3R.2` on S3 hot loop.

## 2026-02-22 12:30:09 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3R.2 fail-closed rollback decision
- S3 fast-path candidate regressed on repeated witnesses:
  - `59.22s`, then `58.50s`.
- Decision:
  - reject candidate,
  - rollback `s3_bucket_counts/runner.py` to known-good baseline (`HEAD`) before proceeding.
- Reason:
  - sustained degradation exceeds noise tolerance and violates fail-closed gate.

## 2026-02-22 12:44:56 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.3R.3 integrated closure recorded
- Completed `POPT.3R.3` witness chain on authority run-id `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`:
  - `S2 PASS` (`wall_ms=46718`),
  - `S3 PASS` (`wall_ms=55093`),
  - `S4 PASS` (`wall_ms=457188`),
  - `S5` first attempt failed (`S5_OUTPUT_CONFLICT`) then passed after non-destructive `.stale_*` housekeeping (`wall_ms=1686`, `bundle_integrity_ok=true`).
- Reopen gate outcome:
  - target gate failed (`S2/S3 > 35s`),
  - stretch gate failed (`S2/S3 > 45s`),
  - downstream/structural guardrails passed.
- `POPT.3R` decision:
  - `HOLD_POPT3_REOPEN`.
- Emitted closure artifacts:

  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt3r_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
- Closure hygiene:
  - `python -m py_compile ...seg_5B/s2_latent_intensity/runner.py ...seg_5B/s3_bucket_counts/runner.py` -> pass.
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` -> no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 12:52:41 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4 planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `POPT.4` in build plan from placeholder into explicit subphases:
  - `POPT.4.0` authority/measurement lock,
  - `POPT.4.1` `S5` replay publish hardening,
  - `POPT.4.2` hot-state logging budget cap (`S2/S3/S4`),
  - `POPT.4.3` integrated witness + veto.
- Locked `POPT.4` scope:
  - owner lanes are `S5` replay-idempotence and hot-state logging cadence only,
  - no realism/policy/schema/contract edits.
- Pinned gates:
  - replay stability on same run-id without nested `.stale_*.stale_*` growth,
  - logging-overhead target `<=2%` versus low-verbosity control lane,
  - structural non-regression and `S5 bundle_integrity_ok=true`.
- Updated immediate execution order:
  - `POPT.1/POPT.2/POPT.3/POPT.3R` treated as closed,
  - `POPT.4` is now the active next phase before `POPT.5` and remediation `P0..P5`.

## 2026-02-22 12:58:22 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4.0 authority lock and fix strategy pinned
- Root cause pinned for replay conflict:
  - `S5` compares bundle index bytes directly, but index contains volatile `generated_utc`; reruns therefore conflict even when logically identical.
- Root cause pinned for logging overhead:
  - `S2/S3/S4` `_ProgressTracker` default cadence remains `0.5s`, causing high-frequency progress logging in long loops.
- Execution strategy locked:
  - `POPT.4.1`: semantic index-equality check in `S5` that ignores volatile `generated_utc` while retaining strict pass-flag digest checks.
  - `POPT.4.2`: add env-configurable progress cadence knobs for `S2/S3/S4` with default `2.0s`.
- Measurement protocol locked:
  - compile gates first,
  - `S5` same-run replay test twice without manual `.stale_*` housekeeping,
  - integrated witness `S2->S3->S4->S5`,
  - compare elapsed against latest pre-POPT4 anchors and veto on structural drift.

## 2026-02-22 13:03:11 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4.1/4.2 code patches applied
- `S5` replay-idempotence patch:
  - replaced bytewise index comparison with semantic comparison that ignores volatile `generated_utc` in bundle index.
  - retained strict conflict checks for non-volatile index mismatch and pass-flag digest mismatch.
- logging budget patch:
  - added env-configurable progress cadence knobs with default `2.0s`:
    - `ENGINE_5B_S2_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`
    - `ENGINE_5B_S3_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`
    - `ENGINE_5B_S4_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`
  - wired cadence into hot-loop trackers in `S2/S3/S4`.
- scope and safety:
  - no policy/schema/contract edits.
  - no data-law or RNG-law edits.
- next steps:
  - compile gates,
  - same-run `S5` replay witness without manual housekeeping,
  - integrated chain witness and veto decision.

## 2026-02-22 13:30 +00:00 - Dev-substrate platform plan extended beyond M10 (M11+)
- USER direction: extend from spine-only certification to full-platform green planning in `dev_min` (no local-parity rebuild and no laptop runtime compute).
- Actions completed:
  - updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` to add `M11/F1`..`M14/F4` with `NOT_STARTED` status,
  - expanded scope lock and program DoD to include Learning/Registry closure and full-platform verdict,
  - pinned mandatory non-regression carry-forward law from `M8..M10`,
  - extended phase evidence map and template coverage to `M1..M14`,
  - added explicit managed stack posture for M11+ (`Terraform`, `GitHub Actions`, `ECS`, `S3`, `RDS`, `Confluent`, `SSM/IAM/KMS`, `CloudWatch`).
- Safety posture:
  - no infra changes/materialization were executed,
  - no branch/history operations executed,
  - existing `M1..M10` certified closure left unchanged.

## 2026-02-22 13:45 +00:00 - M11+ planning structure corrected to execution-grade phase format
- USER feedback accepted: roadmap-only treatment of `M11..M14` was insufficient for build tracking.
- Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` to include full sections for:
  - `M11/F1` (Learning/Registry authority/runtime closure),
  - `M12/F2` (OFS dataset and data-contract closure),
  - `M13/F3` (MF train/eval + MPR corridor closure),
  - `M14/F4` (full-platform certification + spine non-regression verdict).
- Each section now includes:
  - entry gate,
  - objective,
  - scope/out-of-scope,
  - fail-closed posture,
  - sub-phase/deep-plan routing,
  - DoD checklist and exit condition.
- Clarified Section 13 as summary-only and anchored authoritative execution planning to `M11..M14` sections.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only correction,
  - no infrastructure/runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 14:02 +00:00 - Main-plan decision split pinned for M11+ (`pin-now` vs `defer-per-phase`)
- USER question addressed in-plan by explicitly splitting decisions into:
  - cross-phase decisions pinned now,
  - lane-specific decisions deferred to deep phase plans.
- Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` Section 13:
  - added `13.1 Cross-Phase Decisions Pinned Now (Binding)`:
    - canonical verdict chain for `M11..M14`,
    - mandatory `M8..M10` non-regression carry-forward,
    - managed-only runtime law,
    - control-plane law (`Terraform` + `GitHub Actions`),
    - cost/teardown continuity law,
    - evidence publication law (local + durable).
  - added `13.2 Decisions Deferred to Deep Phase Plans (By Design)`:
    - exact handles/IAM/thresholds/blocker taxonomy/snapshot schema details.
  - added fail-closed rule: execution must stop and pin any missing required deferred decision before proceeding.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only update,
  - no infra/runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 13:40:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4 bounded reopen for residual logging-overhead gap
- Parsed `segment5b_popt4_closure_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json` to pin exact gap:
  - replay-idempotence gate: `PASS`,
  - structural invariants gate: `PASS`,
  - logging budget gate: `FAIL` (`2.186%` overhead vs `<=2%` target).
- Chosen path:
  - one bounded reopen of `POPT.4.2` only (default cadence retune),
  - no realism/policy/schema/contract changes,
  - no data-law changes.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - threshold relaxation (weakens gate semantics),
  - immediate hold without bounded retry (premature given very small miss),
  - disabling progress logs (observability loss in long-running S4 lane).
- Next execution sequence pinned:
  - patch default cadence (`S2/S3/S4`) from `2.0s` to `5.0s`,
  - compile gate,
  - integrated witness `S2->S3->S4->S5`,
  - low-verbosity S4 control run + overhead recomputation,
  - final `POPT.4` decision update in build plan and implementation map.

## 2026-02-22 13:41:12 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4R1 cadence retune applied + witness execution
- Applied bounded code-only retune (no policy/schema/contract edits):
  - `S2/S3/S4` default progress cadence changed `2.0s -> 5.0s`,
  - env overrides kept (`ENGINE_5B_S2_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`, `ENGINE_5B_S3_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`, `ENGINE_5B_S4_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SEC`).
- Compile gate:
  - `python -m py_compile ...seg_5B/s2_latent_intensity/runner.py ...seg_5B/s3_bucket_counts/runner.py ...seg_5B/s4_arrival_events/runner.py ...seg_5B/s5_validation_bundle/runner.py` -> `PASS`.

  - `S3 PASS wall_ms=71516`,
  - `S4 PASS wall_ms=527235`,
  - `S5 PASS wall_ms=3109`.
- Replay-idempotence witness:
  - second immediate `S5` rerun `PASS wall_ms=2157` with `bundle already exists and is identical; skipping publish`.
- Logging-budget paired control:
  - `S4 control @30s` -> `wall_ms=437843`,
  - `S4 default recheck @5s` -> `wall_ms=448264`,
  - overhead `= 2.380%` vs target `<=2.000%` -> `FAIL`.
- Structural/non-regression posture:
  - `bucket_rows`, `arrivals_total`, `arrival_rows`, `arrival_virtual`, `missing_group_weights` unchanged,
  - no new stale-dir growth observed.

## 2026-02-22 14:18:04 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4R2 opened (bounded cadence/measurement pass)
- USER direction accepted: open one more bounded pass before finalizing `POPT.4`.
- Scope lock for `POPT.4R2`:
  - cadence default retune only (`S2/S3/S4`),
  - paired `S4` control/candidate measurement refresh,
  - no realism/policy/schema/contract/RNG-law changes.
- Execution sequence pinned:
  - plan entries first (build plan + implementation map),
  - code retune,
  - compile gate,
  - integrated witness `S2->S3->S4->S5`,
  - paired `S4` control (`30s`) + default recheck,
  - final decision lock (`UNLOCK_POPT5_CONTINUE` or `HOLD_POPT4_REOPEN`).

## 2026-02-22 14:19:01 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4R2 executed and closed
- Applied bounded retune:
  - `S2/S3/S4` default progress cadence `5.0s -> 10.0s` (env overrides unchanged).
- Compile gate:

## 2026-02-22 15:06:55 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4R3 opened (final bounded measurement lane)
- USER direction accepted: run one final `POPT.4R3`; if fail again, move on.
- R3 posture pinned:
  - no further code/path changes,
  - measurement-only lane using paired-run median adjudication.
- Protocol:
  - Pair #1 = existing R2 pair evidence,
  - collect two fresh interleaved pairs (`S4@30s` control then `S4@10s` candidate),
  - compute per-pair overhead and median,
  - run post-measurement `S5` replay witness,
  - lock final `POPT.4` decision.

## 2026-02-22 15:07:30 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.4R3 executed and closed
- R3 scope preserved:
  - measurement-only lane, no additional code/path edits.
- Fresh interleaved pairs executed:
  - Pair #2: control `S4@30s wall_ms=466186`, candidate `S4@10s wall_ms=447891`, overhead `-3.925%`.

## 2026-02-22 13:47 +00:00 - M11 deep-plan expansion completed (`platform.M11.build_plan.md`)
- USER direction: expand M11 deeply and add more sub-phases if needed for robust implementation.
- Actions completed:
  - created `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md`,
  - expanded M11 deep decomposition to `M11.A..M11.J` to close all planning lanes,
  - pinned capability-lane coverage matrix and anti-cram execution gate for M11,
  - pinned M11 snapshot contracts, blocker taxonomy families, and planning runtime budgets.
- Main-plan alignment updates:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` now marks M11 deep plan as present,
  - M11 sub-phase list in main plan updated to `A..J`,
  - M11 DoD in main plan updated to include messaging/governance + observability + cost/teardown continuity closure.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only update,
  - no infra/runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 13:52 +00:00 - M11.A planning expansion to execution-grade
- USER direction: plan out `M11.A`.
- Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md` (`### M11.A`) with:
  - required inputs,
  - fail-closed preparation checks,
  - deterministic closure algorithm,
  - required snapshot schema fields (`m11_a_authority_handoff_snapshot.json`),
  - runtime-budget gate,
  - expanded blocker taxonomy (`M11A-B1..B6`).
- Cross-phase anchoring added in M11.A:
  - uses M10 verdict + bundle-index artifacts (local + durable),
  - explicitly references main-plan pin sections `13.1` and `13.2`.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only update,
  - no infra/runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 14:37 +00:00 - Repin recorded: `M11+` targets dev_full; authority stubs materialized
- USER clarified migration direction:
  - `dev_min` is the minimum managed spine rung (off-laptop migration proof),
  - Learning/Evolution + full-platform closure should be built on `dev_full`,
  - objective includes managed-toolchain exposure (SageMaker/Aurora/Databricks/MLflow/Airflow class tools), not handwritten replicas.
- Actions completed:
  - created `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-full_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`,
  - created `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`,
  - updated `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/README.md` to include dev_full authority pair and scope split.
- Fail-closed posture pinned:
  - `M11` remains blocked for execution while required `dev_full` handle keys are `TBD_M11B`.
  - no implicit fallback to `dev_min` for `M11+` runtime lanes.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only update,
  - no infra/runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 14:55 +00:00 - M11.A execution pre-lock: drift patch required before closure run
- USER direction: patch `M11.A` drift and begin execution immediately.
- Drift check found 3 blockers in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md`:
  - entry condition text implied dual-source readability (local + durable) while algorithm is local-first/durable-fallback,
  - authority completeness text blocked unresolved `TBD` globally in M11.A, conflicting with planned `M11.B` handle closure (`TBD_M11B`),
  - deterministic algorithm had duplicate step number `6`.
- Execution decision:
  - patch M11.A wording first (fail-closed alignment),
  - run inline M11.A closure (no new local tool files),
  - emit local snapshot and attempt durable publish,
  - if publish fails, record `M11A-B5` and hold.

## 2026-02-22 14:57 +00:00 - M11.A patched + executed (PASS)
- Patched `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md` before execution:
  - entry-readability rule aligned to local-first/durable-fallback per artifact,
  - `TBD` scope corrected so `TBD_M11B` remains M11.B closure work (not M11.A blocker),
  - deterministic step numbering corrected.
- Executed inline M11.A closure run (no new utility files):
  - validated M10 verdict posture (`ADVANCE_CERTIFIED_DEV_MIN`, `overall_pass=true`, no blockers),
  - validated authority reference readability,
  - built and emitted authority handoff snapshot.
- Evidence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m11/m11_20260222T145654Z/m11_a_authority_handoff_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m11_20260222T145654Z/m11_a_authority_handoff_snapshot.json`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - blockers empty
  - M11 moved to `ACTIVE` in main build plan; M11.A execution note added.

## 2026-02-22 15:08 +00:00 - M11.B planning expanded to execution-grade
- USER direction: "Let's plan out M11.B."
- Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md` `### M11.B` with:
  - entry conditions tied to M11.A pass snapshot,
  - required inputs and explicit required-handle set (`DF_*` keys `1..18`),
  - fail-closed preparation checks and deterministic closure algorithm,
  - required snapshot schema fields for `m11_b_handle_closure_snapshot.json`,
  - runtime budget gate (`<=20 min`) and blocker taxonomy (`M11B-B1..B7`),
  - DoD checks including owner mapping to downstream M11 lanes.
- Safety posture:
  - documentation-only planning update,
  - no runtime execution,
  - no branch/history operations.

## 2026-02-22 15:13 +00:00 - M11.B owner-mapping drift correction before execution
- While preparing execution matrix, identified a planning drift:
  - allowed owner set in M11.B excluded `M11.G`, but metrics/alerts handles are observability surfaces.
- Patched `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M11.build_plan.md`:
  - owner mapping now allows `M11.C/M11.D/M11.E/M11.F/M11.G/M11.H/M11.I`.
- Reason for immediate fix:
  - avoid forced mis-assignment of observability handles to unrelated lanes during closure execution.

## 2026-02-22 15:16 +00:00 - M11.B full execution (PASS)
- Pre-execution decision:
  - selected mixed managed toolchain pin set for dev_full handles (Step Functions run/operate + Airflow learning-control + Databricks/SageMaker/MLflow surfaces), aligning with USER objective and authority direction.
- Patched handle registry:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - all required `DF_*` keys in Section 3 moved to concrete `PINNED` values (no `TBD_M11B` retained).
- Executed M11.B closure algorithm inline (no new helper files):
  - loaded M11.A snapshot dependency and validated pass gate,
  - parsed `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` required-handle table,
  - computed deterministic 18-key resolution matrix,
  - validated unresolved/placeholder/missing/duplicate/owner-ambiguity counters.
- Evidence emitted:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m11/m11_20260222T145654Z/m11_b_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m11_20260222T145654Z/m11_b_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - blockers empty
  - counters: `required_total=18`, `resolved_count=18`, `unresolved_count=0`, `placeholder_or_wildcard_count=0`, `missing_or_duplicate_key_count=0`.
- Follow-up documentation updates:
  - marked M11.B DoD complete in `platform.M11.build_plan.md`,
  - added M11.B execution notes in `platform.build_plan.md`.

## 2026-02-22 15:24 +00:00 - M11.C first execution attempt blocker (`M11C-B1`)
- Initial `M11.C` closure run produced blocker `M11C-B1`:
  - OFS/MF module help checks were executed without pack env (`PYTHONPATH=src`), causing module resolution errors.
- Decision:
  - treat as validation-environment drift (not runtime-topology drift),
  - rerun M11.C with pack-conformant env checks.
- Plan patch:
  - M11.C command conformance check now explicitly references pack env context.

## 2026-02-22 15:31 +00:00 - M11.E pre-lock: execution-grade expansion required before closure
- USER sequencing respected: expand `M11.E` first, then execute.
- Detected readiness gaps in current M11.E section:
  - no explicit M11.D dependency checks,
  - no deterministic required-key set for store/path contracts,
  - no overlap/conflict algorithm for ownership matrix,
  - no run-scope/retention predicate checks,
  - no snapshot schema for auditable closure.
- Decision before execution:
  - expand `M11.E` to execution-grade,
  - pin missing data-contract handles in `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`,
  - then run closure and publish `m11_e_data_contract_snapshot.json`.
- Safety posture:
  - no branch operations,
  - no secrets in docs,
  - no runtime infra mutation.

## 2026-02-22 15:34 +00:00 - M11.E first execution blocker (`M11E-B2`) and remediation
- First M11.E run failed with `M11E-B2`.
- Cause: markdown-table values were backtick-quoted; retention integer checks parsed raw values and failed.
- Decision: keep registry style intact and normalize parsed handle values during closure checks.
- Re-ran M11.E with normalized parser.

## 2026-02-22 15:35 +00:00 - M11.E full execution (PASS)
- Added M11.E handle family in `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` Section 7:
  - archive/dataset/eval/registry roots + retention day handles.
- Executed deterministic M11.E closure checks:
  - M11.D dependency pass,
  - required E handle resolution,
  - owner uniqueness/path conflict checks,
  - run-scope semantics checks,
  - retention parse checks.
- Evidence emitted:

  - blockers empty.

## 2026-02-22 15:36 +00:00 - M11.F pre-lock: expand before execute
- Sequencing respected: M11.E pass first, now expand M11.F before execution.
- Gaps found in current M11.F section:
  - no explicit M11.E dependency gate,
  - no required messaging/authn handle family,
  - no deterministic ownership/conflict algorithm,
  - no MPR fail-closed predicate checks,
  - no execution-grade snapshot schema.
- Decision:
  - expand M11.F section,
  - pin explicit M11.F handles,
  - execute closure and publish evidence.

## 2026-02-22 15:41 +00:00 - M11.F full execution (PASS)
- Expanded `M11.F` to execution-grade before run:
  - M11.E dependency gate,
  - required messaging/governance/authn handle set,
  - deterministic ownership/authn/corridor checks,
  - snapshot schema + budget gate.
- Added `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` Section 8:
  - `DF_LEARNING_EVENT_BUS_HANDLE`, `DF_*_TOPIC`, MPR authn/allowed-actors/resolution/fail-closed handles.
- Executed M11.F closure checks inline:
  - dependency pass verification,
  - required-handle resolution,
  - producer/consumer ownership matrix validation,
  - governance authn actor constraints,
  - MPR promotion/rollback corridor and fail-closed resolution checks.

  - `overall_pass=true`
  - blockers empty.

## 2026-02-22 15:44 +00:00 - M11.G pre-lock: expand before execute
- Sequencing accepted: `M11.G` expanded first, then executed before moving to `M11.H`.
- Detected readiness gaps in current M11.G:
  - no explicit M11.F dependency gate,
  - no required observability/evidence handle family,
  - no deterministic evidence-family/schema/taxonomy checks,
  - no runtime budget gate.
- Decision:
  - add M11.G handle family in registry,
  - expand M11.G to execution-grade,
  - execute closure and publish snapshot.

## 2026-02-22 15:48 +00:00 - M11.G full execution (PASS)
- Expanded M11.G to execution-grade and pinned observability/evidence handle family (registry Section 9).
- Executed deterministic closure checks:
  - M11.F dependency pass,
  - required handle resolution,
  - required evidence-family completeness (`M11.A..M11.F`),
  - minimum schema contract pin,
  - blocker taxonomy family coverage (`M11A-B*..M11J-B*`),
  - non-secret evidence policy.

  - `overall_pass=true`
  - blockers empty.

## 2026-02-22 15:49 +00:00 - M11.H pre-lock: expand before execute
- M11.G pass is complete; next sequential lane is M11.H.
- Identified planning gaps in current M11.H:
  - no explicit source snapshot set for M8/M9/M10 carry-forward,
  - no deterministic probe/threshold table,
  - no rerun policy and blocker-mode closure contract.
- Decision:
  - expand M11.H to execution-grade,
  - pin non-regression handle family,
  - execute closure with deterministic probe matrix.

## 2026-02-22 15:55 +00:00 - Segment 5B POPT.5 planned and executed (performance certification lock)
- Implemented dedicated certification scorer:
  - `tools/score_segment5b_popt5_certification.py`
- Scorer consumes accepted POPT evidence (`POPT.0`, `POPT.1`, `POPT.2`, `POPT.3R`, `POPT.4R3`) and latest `S1..S5` witness timings.
- Emitted POPT.5 certification artifacts:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt5_certification_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B/reports/segment5b_popt5_certification_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
- Certification outcome:
  - decision: `GO_P0`
  - verdict: `PASS_RUNTIME_CERTIFIED_WITH_ACCEPTED_RESIDUAL_BUDGET_MISS`
  - lane-budget posture: candidate `00:09:25` vs target `00:07:00` (residual explicitly carried forward).
- Updated plan/docs:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.build_plan.md`
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
- Hygiene:
  - `python tools/prune_failed_runs.py --runs-root runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5B` -> no failed sentinels.

## 2026-02-22 15:53 +00:00 - M11.H full execution (PASS)
- Expanded M11.H to execution-grade and pinned non-regression handle family (registry Section 10).

- Decision:
  - expand M11.I to execution-grade,
  - pin continuity handles in registry Section 11,
  - execute closure and publish snapshot.

## 2026-02-22 15:58 +00:00 - M11.I full execution (PASS)
- Expanded M11.I to execution-grade and pinned continuity handle family (registry Section 11).
- Executed deterministic continuity checks:
  - M11.H dependency pass,
  - required-handle closure,
  - learning phase-profile posture (`on_demand`, `desired_count=0`, run-task mode, positive TTL),

  - blockers empty.

## 2026-02-22 16:00 +00:00 - M11 status sync after G/H/I closure
- Updated `platform.M11.build_plan.md` and `platform.build_plan.md` to keep status aligned:
  - `M11.A..M11.I` now marked complete,
  - `M11.J` is the only remaining open sub-phase.
- Added G/H/I evidence refs to main M11 execution notes and updated M11 DoD checklist progression.
