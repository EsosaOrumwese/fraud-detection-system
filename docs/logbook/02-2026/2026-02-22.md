## 2026-02-22 00:03:12 +00:00 - Correction: B+ stretch-recovery plan moved to 5A remediation build plan
- User clarified prior request target: Segment `5A` (not `5B`).
- Added explicit post-freeze B+ recovery lane to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.build_plan.md`
  - new section `9) Post-freeze B+ stretch recovery lane`
  - new phase family `P6` (`P6.1`..`P6.5`) with owner-state mapping and hard-gate veto posture.
- Targeted stretch blockers pinned in 5A plan:
  - `max_class_share <= 0.50`
  - `max_single_country_share_within_class <= 0.35`
  - `nontrivial_tzids >= 230`
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio <= 1.6`
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`
- Added scope-correction note to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
  - marks earlier 5B insertion as superseded for this request (audit continuity preserved).
