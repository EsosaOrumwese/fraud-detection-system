## 2026-02-22 00:03:12 +00:00 - Correction: B+ stretch-recovery plan moved to 5A remediation build plan
- User clarified prior request target: Segment `5A` (not `5B`).
- Added explicit post-freeze B+ recovery lane to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.build_plan.md`
  - new section `9) Post-freeze B+ stretch recovery lane`
  - new phase family `P6` (`P6.1`..`P6.5`) with owner-state mapping and hard-gate veto posture.
- Targeted stretch blockers pinned in 5A plan:
  - `max_class_share <= 0.50`
  - `max_single_country_share_within_class <= 0.35`
  - `nontrivial_tzids >= 230`
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio <= 1.6`
- Appended matching decision-trail entry to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`
- Added scope-correction note to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5B.impl_actual.md`
  - marks earlier 5B insertion as superseded for this request (audit continuity preserved).

## 2026-02-22 00:09:54 +00:00 - 5A P6 full execution started (decision-locked)
- Began full execution of `P6` (`P6.1 -> P6.5`) with strict hard-gate veto and continuous reasoning logging.
- Re-validated active authority gateboard and confirmed four stretch blockers:
  - `max_class_share_lte_0.50`,
  - `max_country_share_within_class_lte_0.35`,
  - `nontrivial_tzids_gte_230` (seed 42),
  - `overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6`.
- Computed blocker anatomy before tuning:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` dominance (~0.54 share),
  - within-class driver: `evening_weekend@DK` on seeds 7/101/202; `online_bursty@FR` on seed 42,
  - overlay miss remains bounded but persistent across all required seeds.
- Chosen execution posture:
  - owner-lane sequential closure (`S1/S2` concentration -> `S3` tail -> `S4` overlay),
  - promotion only on no-hard-regression evidence.
- Detailed plan + alternatives recorded in:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:09`).

## 2026-02-22 00:12:32 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration calibration lane locked (pre-edit)
- Staged two-seed S1 calibration probes:
  - seed42 lane: `9478621ed6e5422aa92f5c717ffe432f`,
  - seed7 lane: `e8b2a62fae2946608b32730d85685466`.
- Baseline concentration diagnostics on probes confirm blocker owners:
  - max-class driver: `consumer_daytime` (`~0.54` share),
  - within-class driver: `online_bursty@FR` (seed42) and `evening_weekend@DK` (seed7).
- Chosen first policy-only candidate (low blast):
  - modest global skew dampening + targeted tail-shape dampening for `consumer_daytime`, `evening_weekend`, `online_bursty`.
- Detailed alternatives and candidate rationale appended to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md` (Entry `2026-02-22 00:12`).

## 2026-02-22 00:16:47 +00:00 - P6.2 concentration lane calibrated and promoted
- Candidate A policy attempt improved `max_class_share` but failed promotion due seed7 within-class regression:
  - seed7 `max_country_share_within_class` worsened to `~0.438` (`evening_weekend@DK` still dominant).
- Performed root-cause drilldown on `class_source` and country contributions; confirmed cap-bound DK dominance in `evening_weekend`.
- Candidate B correction applied:
  - raised `evening_weekend.median_per_site_weekly` (while retaining other dampeners) to increase non-DK denominator mass.
- Candidate B concentration metrics (S1 surface) on staged 4-seed set:
  - `9478621...` (seed42): `max_class_share=0.487069`, `max_country_share_within_class=0.265012`,
  - `e8b2a62...` (seed7): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `bb03bafa...` (seed101): `0.483730`, `0.289782`,
  - `cdf9a772...` (seed202): `0.483730`, `0.289782`.
- `P6.2` stretch concentration target is closed at S1 level for all staged seeds.
- Next move: replay `S2 -> S5` on staged runs for integrated P6 scoring and continue with P6.3/P6.4 closure.

## 2026-02-22 00:40:03 +00:00 - P6.4 pre-implementation decision lock (S4 overlay fairness lane)
- Locked P6.4 design before editing code: remaining blocker is overlay_p90_p10_ratio_lte_1.6 after P6.2/P6.3 movement.
- Chosen approach: bounded deterministic S4 fairness regularizer on a minimal subset of neutral rows in under-covered countries (tiny 1±delta perturbations, deterministic ordering).
- Rejected alternatives:
  - policy-only broad amplitude/calendar retune (higher blast, weak direct control of quantile ratio),
  - scorer reinterpretation (metric surface already pinned).
- Promotion veto rails pinned: no hard-gate regressions, no top-country zero-coverage regressions, rollback if pilot shows weak ratio movement.
- Detailed reasoning trail appended in docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md.

## 2026-02-22 00:59:32 +00:00 - P6.4/P6.5 closure completed: Segment 5A promoted to PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST
- Implemented bounded deterministic S4 overlay fairness regularizer in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5A/s4_calendar_overlays/runner.py`.
- Resolved two pilot defects:
  - `__cum_prev` expression-order issue,
  - `u64 -> i64` cast overflow on merchant parity logic.
- Executed staged closure run-set with explicit `runs_root` and `S4 -> S5` replay:
  - seed42 `07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b`,
  - seed7 `6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528`,
  - seed101 `efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e`,
  - seed202 `4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9`.
- Integrated gateboard decision:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_5A/reports/segment5a_p5_realism_gateboard_07af961b2ba34a9192e2ba107b33e06b__6c4973df73084bcba92a725de8ba9528__efcf57f1ca8f411b888107bf021ce55e__4955a5612d5c45b38fe5c4cbdbc50cc9.json`
  - result `PASS_BPLUS_ROBUST` (all hard + stretch gates green on required seeds).
- Updated build plan P6 DoDs + phase status accordingly.
- Detailed decision trail appended to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_5A.impl_actual.md`.
