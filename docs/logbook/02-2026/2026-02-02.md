- 2026-02-02 08:52:35 — Corrected control & ingress narrative: removed Context Preloader assumption; context is now streamed via EB topics (arrival events/entities + flow anchors), baseline flow anchor optional when baseline runs are enabled.

- 2026-02-02 09:02:45 — Updated Phase 3 EB requirements: traffic + context topics; single‑mode per run (fraud OR baseline); RTDL retention/context store shape explicitly deferred to Phase 4.

- 2026-02-02 09:07:55 — Stream-sort alignment: added fraud/baseline context output lists + make targets; runbook updated to sort required context datasets with fraud default.

- 2026-02-02 19:38:30 — WSP wiring updated to include context output lists (fraud default, baseline optional) and merge traffic+context outputs for streaming; profiles updated.

- 2026-02-02 19:38:45 — IG schema/class/partitioning updated for context outputs; new EB context topics added to LocalStack bootstrap.

- 2026-02-02 19:39:05 — Build plans updated (WSP/IG/EB/SR) to reflect single‑mode traffic + context topics.

- 2026-02-02 19:55:44 — Re-scoped control & ingress to traffic-only (baseline OR fraud); removed context refs from profiles/runbook and narrowed parity bootstrap streams.
- 2026-02-02 20:05:51 — Correction: user confirmed WSP must stream traffic + context and EB must expose both; restoring context refs + parity streams + runbook/build plans.

- 2026-02-02 20:24:14 — Ran parity 200-event check: SR READY run_id=6725f5eafb1ba93b5115b2d639bb6889; WSP started traffic+context streams (200 per output) and IG published to EB traffic/context topics; IG receipts stored under platform_20260202T201828Z.
