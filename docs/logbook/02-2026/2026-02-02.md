- 2026-02-02 08:52:35 — Corrected control & ingress narrative: removed Context Preloader assumption; context is now streamed via EB topics (arrival events/entities + flow anchors), baseline flow anchor optional when baseline runs are enabled.

- 2026-02-02 09:02:45 — Updated Phase 3 EB requirements: traffic + context topics; single‑mode per run (fraud OR baseline); RTDL retention/context store shape explicitly deferred to Phase 4.

- 2026-02-02 09:07:55 — Stream-sort alignment: added fraud/baseline context output lists + make targets; runbook updated to sort required context datasets with fraud default.

- 2026-02-02 19:38:30 — WSP wiring updated to include context output lists (fraud default, baseline optional) and merge traffic+context outputs for streaming; profiles updated.

- 2026-02-02 19:38:45 — IG schema/class/partitioning updated for context outputs; new EB context topics added to LocalStack bootstrap.

- 2026-02-02 19:39:05 — Build plans updated (WSP/IG/EB/SR) to reflect single‑mode traffic + context topics.

- 2026-02-02 19:55:44 — Re-scoped control & ingress to traffic-only (baseline OR fraud); removed context refs from profiles/runbook and narrowed parity bootstrap streams.
