* 4:33AM
  - Opened P3 build-plan expansion task for Segment `1A`.
  - Logged pre-edit design note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to capture rationale before changing the plan.
  - Planned P3 rewrite structure:
    - freeze guardrails,
    - baseline + CI scorer,
    - identity semantics hardening,
    - legal mismatch closure under frozen upstream,
    - conditional minimal reopen protocol,
    - replay lock criteria.
* 4:34AM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md` to expand P3 into explicit execution sub-phases.
  - Added:
    - P3 freeze guardrails (protect P1/P2 locks),
    - fixed size/identity scoring choices,
    - target metric definitions + CI requirement,
    - P3.1..P3.4 DoD structure,
    - anti-forging/veto calibration method,
    - fail-closed conditional reopen protocol.
  - Appended post-edit decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:38AM
  - Started migration-doc drift patch pass per USER instruction (four-item closure set).
  - Logged pre-change lock in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md` with scope, decisions, and validation plan.
  - Targeted files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/README.md`
* 4:39AM
  - Started Segment `1A` Phase `P3.1` execution (baseline/scoring harness).
  - Read and anchored to state/spec authorities before edits:
    - `state.1A.s8.expanded.md`,
    - `state.1A.s9.expanded.md`,
    - `schemas.1A.yaml`, `schemas.layer1.yaml`, `dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml`,
    - `segment_1A_remediation_report.md`,
    - P3 section in `segment_1A.build_plan.md`.
  - Appended pre-edit design/decision note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` describing P3.1 tooling plan (`segment1a-p3` target + verifier + scorer).
* 4:39AM
  - Applied 3-file migration-doc patch set.
  - `dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`:
    - aligned image handle key to `IMAGE_TAG_DEV_MIN_LATEST`,
    - removed stale "pin later" wording for `CONFIG_DIGEST_ALGO` and `REPORTER_LOCK_BACKEND`,
    - replaced Section 1.10 open-items block with pinned-closure status,
    - removed local-parity bootstrap allowance in P3 seed semantics.
  - `dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`:
    - set `ORACLE_SEED_OPERATOR_PRESTEP_REQUIRED = false`,
    - added anti-regression note to keep P3 seed strictly managed object-store-only.
  - `migration_to_dev/README.md`:
    - promoted from scaffold wording to authority index + working rule.
  - Ran validation grep + diff checks confirming targeted drifts are closed.
* 4:42AM
  - Implemented P3.1 harness artifacts:
    - `tools/verify_segment1a_p3_outputs.py` (required P3 surfaces check),
    - `tools/score_segment1a_p3_1_baseline.py` (global/stratified metrics + CIs + duplicate diagnostics),
    - `makefile` target wiring for `segment1a-p3` / `segment1a-p3-check`.
  - Ran script/target smoke checks:
    - `py_compile` pass,
    - `--help` pass for both tools,
    - `make -n segment1a-p3-check` pass.
  - Appended implementation decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:48AM
  - Ran `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`; pipeline reached S7 then failed with `F4:E_DIRICHLET_NONPOS` (`alpha=0.0`) before S8.
  - Confirmed failure artifact at run-local `failure.json` and traced root-cause to S7 dirichlet diagnostics lane (`alpha0 * share` hard-fail on zero-share entries).
  - Logged blocker triage + planned minimal S7 robustness patch in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` before editing code.
* 4:48AM
  - Patched `S7` dirichlet diagnostics robustness in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s7_integerisation/runner.py`:
    - keep fail on non-finite/negative alpha,
    - floor zero alpha to `1e-12` to avoid `E_DIRICHLET_NONPOS` abort.
  - Ran `py_compile` on patched runner (pass).
  - Logged post-edit implementation note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:49AM
  - Created fresh execution build plan at `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
  - Plan now includes:
    - scope/authority lock,
    - non-negotiable migration guardrails,
    - progressive-elaboration rules,
    - canonical roadmap (M0..M10 mapped to P(-1), P0..P12),
    - detailed active phase (`M0`) with DoD checklist,
    - transition checklist and next action.
  - Appended matching pre/post decision trail entries in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:58AM
  - Audited fresh `platform.build_plan.md` against `dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md` gate/evidence posture.
  - Found structure sound but grouped phase DoDs (M6/M7/M9/M10) were too compressed for safe execution interpretation.
  - Opened targeted hardening patch to increase runbook DoD fidelity while keeping plan high-level.
* 5:00AM
  - Applied pre-commit hardening pass on `platform.build_plan.md` after runbook fidelity review.
  - Tightened grouped DoD summaries (M2..M10) to explicitly reflect key runbook gates/evidence surfaces.
  - Added `9.1 High-Level Evidence Fidelity Map` linking each plan phase to minimum evidence families.
  - Confirmed progressive-elaboration model remains intact (single active phase, gated transitions).
* 5:06AM
  - Opened build-plan hardening pass to move certification from count-only (20/200) to two-layer validation:
    - Semantic Green (20/200 smoke for laws/gates),
    - Scale Green (representative window + burst + soak + recovery under load).
  - Target file: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
* 5:06AM
  - Applied build-plan certification upgrade from count-only to two-layer model:
    - Semantic Green (20/200 law-gate smoke),
    - Scale Green (representative-window, burst, soak, recovery under load).
  - Updated M10 roadmap label, M10 DoD, and evidence mapping.
  - Added `9.2 Scale-Green Threshold Pinning Rule` with explicit rule: 20/200 alone cannot close M10.
* 5:10AM
  - Recorded user-pinned validation posture:
    - 20/200 is semantic smoke only,
    - dev certification requires Scale Green (representative-window, burst, soak, recovery),
    - cannot claim dev-green on count-capped runs alone.
  - Linked enforcement to build-plan sections (Global DoD, M10, 9.2 threshold pinning rule).
* 5:16AM
  - Opened planning-structure pass to support per-phase deep docs (`platform.M*.md`) with main plan retained as status control hub.
  - Scope for this pass:
    - expand `platform.build_plan.md` routing/ownership rules,
    - create `platform.M0.build_plan.md` deep plan,
    - planning only (no build/infra execution).
* 5:17AM
  - Applied planning-structure update:
    - main plan expanded with deep-phase routing + status ownership,
    - created `platform.M0.build_plan.md` for detailed M0 planning,
    - updated dev_substrate README to reflect the new pattern.
  - Confirmed this pass remains planning-only (no runtime build execution).
* 5:22AM
  - Opened M0 closure pass (governance implementation only).
  - Planned outcomes:
    - finalize missing M0 governance artifacts,
    - mark M0 checklists complete,
    - set M0 closed in roadmap,
    - keep M1 pending explicit user activation.
* 5:22AM
  - Completed M0 implementation as a full governance closure.
  - Main plan updates:
    - M0 set to `DONE`,
    - M1 kept `NOT_STARTED` pending explicit user activation,
    - added phase evidence template section,
    - added user-governed transition authority rule.
  - M0 deep plan updates:
    - all sub-DoD and completion checklists marked complete,
    - added closure snapshot with evidence references.
  - No runtime/infra build execution performed in this pass.
* 5:38AM
  - Activated next-phase planning step:
    - set `M1` as active in main plan,
    - author deep M1 plan doc (`platform.M1.build_plan.md`),
    - keep this pass planning-only (no image/infra execution).
* 5:39AM
  - Activated M1 in main build plan and created `platform.M1.build_plan.md` deep plan.
  - Updated README to reflect M0 closed and M1 active deep-plan file.
  - This pass remained planning-only; no image build/push or infra/runtime execution was started.
* 5:51AM
  - Stopped the stuck `segment1a-p3` run process chain for run-id `ddc8e46d9e25fe160800ad878d1fa8c9` after observing S7 dirichlet pathological runtime.
  - Replaced the interim S7 alpha-floor patch with a corrective strategy:
    - skip dirichlet payload emission for merchants with any nonpositive share,
    - keep deterministic integerisation/residual-rank path active,
    - keep strict invalid-alpha checks inside payload generation.
  - Re-ran `py_compile` on the S7 runner (pass).
  - Appended corrective decision trail in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 5:56AM
  - Completed `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A` successfully after S7 corrective patch.
  - P3.1 baseline run-id: `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147`.
  - Baseline report written:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147.json`.
  - Key global baseline outcomes:
    - `home_legal_mismatch_rate=0.3971` (fails B/B+),
    - `size_gradient_pp=+1.84pp` (fails B/B+),
    - unexplained duplicate anomalies = `0` (pass).
  - Updated build-plan P3.1 DoD checkboxes to complete and added run/report evidence line.
  - Pruned interrupted run folder `ddc8e46d9e25fe160800ad878d1fa8c9` to control storage.
  - Appended full closure entry to `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 5:57AM
  - Cleaned P3 score script warning: switched Polars `with_row_count` -> `with_row_index` in `tools/score_segment1a_p3_1_baseline.py`.
  - Re-ran `py_compile` for the script (pass).
* 5:58AM
  - Re-ran P3 scorecard tool on run `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147` after warning cleanup to refresh report output and confirm no runtime warning.
  - Report path unchanged:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147.json`.
* 6:22AM
  - Opened Segment `1A` P3.2/P3.3 tuning pass using baseline run `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147` as authority.
  - Completed baseline diagnostics for mismatch closure:
    - global mismatch remains `0.3971`,
    - size gradient remains `+1.84pp`,
    - decile profile is broad/high rather than enterprise-skewed.
  - Decision locked before edits:
    - keep P1/P2 frozen,
    - remediate via minimal reopen surface `S7` count-allocation posture only,
    - implement size-conditioned home-share floor in S7 (policy + runner) and re-score.
  - Appended pre-edit reasoning trail in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 6:24AM
  - Implemented P3.3 tuning lane in S7:
    - added optional `home_bias_lane` (piecewise `home_share_min` by `n_outlets`) to S7 policy schema + runner,
    - configured initial tiers in `config/layer1/1A/allocation/s7_integerisation_policy.yaml`.
  - First post-change run:
    - `run_id=66b5e575c89a1767eef8c5d600620ad4`,
    - failed in S7 with `F4:E_RESIDUAL_QUANTISATION` (`residual_out_of_range`).
  - Applied corrective quantization guard:
    - clamp near-zero/near-one floating artifacts at `dp_resid=8` in `_quantize_residual`,
    - preserve hard-fail posture for true out-of-domain residuals.
* 6:32AM
  - Re-ran `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`.
  - Accepted tuned run:
    - `run_id=4ebfb92774e2db438989863f8f641162`.
  - P3 scorecard:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_4ebfb92774e2db438989863f8f641162.json`.
  - Global outcomes:
    - `home_legal_mismatch_rate=0.118602` (B pass),
    - `size_gradient_pp=+11.305` (B/B+ pass),
    - unexplained duplicate anomalies = `0`.
  - P2 regression check:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p2_regression_4ebfb92774e2db438989863f8f641162.json`,
    - global P2 gates remained pass.
* 6:33AM
  - Executed P3.2 hardening edits:
    - explicit local `site_id` scope wording in:
      - `schemas.1A.yaml#/egress/outlet_catalogue`,
      - `dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml` (`outlet_catalogue` description),
    - explicit S9 fail-closed check for `duplicate_local_site_id` in:
      - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s9_validation/runner.py`.
  - Ran S9 on pre-wording run `4eb...`; decision was `FAIL` due lineage seal mismatch after authority-file edits (expected because sealed digests no longer matched that run’s snapshot).
* 6:36AM
  - Re-ran P3 on updated contract authority set for lineage-consistent evidence.
  - Accepted run:
    - `run_id=59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee`.
  - P3 scorecard:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee.json`.
  - Global outcomes remained closed:
    - `home_legal_mismatch_rate=0.116997` (B pass),
    - `size_gradient_pp=+11.660` (B/B+ pass),
    - unexplained duplicate anomalies = `0`.
  - P2 regression (same run):
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p2_regression_59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee.json`,
    - global P2 checks remained pass.
* 6:41AM
  - Ran `make segment1a-s9 ... SEG1A_S9_RUN_ID=59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee`.
  - S9 decision on the updated-authority run: `PASS`.
  - Updated `segment_1A.build_plan.md`:
    - marked P3.2 DoD complete with evidence,
    - marked P3.3 DoD complete with evidence,
    - left P3.4 open.
* 6:44AM
  - Storage hygiene:
    - removed superseded intermediate run folder `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/4ebfb92774e2db438989863f8f641162`.
  - Current retained run-id folders under `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`:
    - `59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee` (accepted P3.2/P3.3 run),
    - `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147` (P3.1 baseline authority),
    - `9901b537de3a5a146f79365931bd514c` and `d6e04d5dc57b9dc3f41ac59508cafd3f` (P2 lock pair),
    - `c83b1c5110b3d1c2803b7f01de959d5d` (legacy retained evidence).
* 6:45AM
  - Opened B+ mismatch targeting pass before P3.4:
    - current P3 accepted run is B-pass but below B+ mismatch lower bound (`~0.117 < 0.12`),
    - plan is minimal S7-only retune on the largest-merchant home-bias tier,
    - keep gradient/identity closed and enforce P2 non-regression checks after each run.
* 7:35AM
  - P3.3 B+ retune iteration A (S7 final tier only):
    - changed `home_bias_lane` final tier `home_share_min` from `0.65` to `0.62` in `s7_integerisation_policy.yaml`,
    - ran `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`,

    - accepted run id: `da3e57e73e733b990a5aa3a46705f987`.
  - P3 outcomes on accepted run:
    - `home_legal_mismatch_rate=0.122534` (B+ pass),
    - `size_gradient_pp=+13.076` (B/B+ pass),
    - no unexplained duplicate anomalies.
  - P2 non-regression on the same run:
    - `verify_segment1a_p2_outputs.py` -> `PASS`,
    - score report: `segment1a_p2_regression_da3e57e73e733b990a5aa3a46705f987.json` (global checks pass).
* 7:49AM
  - Started P3.4 replay/stability closure:
    - ran fresh same-seed replay with unchanged knobs:
      - `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`,
      - replay run id: `a212735023c748a710e4b851046849f8`.
  - Replay outcomes:
    - P3 checks all pass (including B+ mismatch and B+ gradient),
    - same `seed=42` and same `parameter_hash=79d755e7132bdcc9915b5db695a42a0ab5261b14b3d72e84c38ed4c725d874dd` as `da3...`,
    - key metric deltas vs `da3...` are exactly `0.0` (deterministic replay hold).
  - Replay P2 non-regression:
    - `verify_segment1a_p2_outputs.py` -> `PASS`,
    - score report: `segment1a_p2_regression_a212735023c748a710e4b851046849f8.json` (global checks pass).
* 7:52AM

    - `segment_1A.build_plan.md`: upgraded P3.3 closure evidence to B+, marked P3.4 DoD complete, added lock record and replay evidence.
    - `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`: appended decision trail entries for B+ tuning iterations and P3.4 replay closure.
* 8:01AM
  - Pruned superseded P3 tuning run folder:
    - removed `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/b717147dacb3830324cc8ff32a018588`.
  - Verified retained run-id folders now:
    - `59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee`,
    - `9901b537de3a5a146f79365931bd514c`,

    - `da3e57e73e733b990a5aa3a46705f987`.
  - Started and recorded P3.4 handoff closure in build planning:
    - added `P3.4 Handoff closure record` section in `segment_1A.build_plan.md`,
    - captured acceptance/replay authority run-ids, prune evidence, retained-run set, and frozen-for-P4 assumption.
* 8:13AM
  - Expanded Segment `1A` P4 planning in `segment_1A.build_plan.md` from high-level notes into phased execution design.
  - Added new P4 sections:
    - `6.6 Baseline gap snapshot` on lock run `da3e57e73e733b990a5aa3a46705f987`,
    - `6.7 P4 invariants` (explicit P1/P2/P3 non-regression posture),
    - `6.8 P4 phased approach and DoD` (`P4.1` to `P4.5`),
    - `6.9 Planned execution order` (state-aligned).
  - Recorded baseline gap snapshot from lock run:
    - all five required artifacts currently absent (`s3_integerised_counts`, `s3_site_sequence`, `sparse_flag`, `merchant_abort_log`, `hurdle_stationarity_tests`).
  - Appended matching design/decision trail entry in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
  - This step was planning-only; no runtime/state code changes were executed.
* 8:23AM
  - Started P4 one-pass implementation (user-directed "all in one fell swoop").
  - Pinned pre-edit execution posture in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`:
    - emit all five required P4 artifacts,
    - keep S8 count authority locked on S7 handoff (no silent statistical reopen),
    - add fail-closed S9 checks for artifact presence/schema,
    - close with full `segment1a-p4` run evidence.
* 8:38AM
  - First P4 run achieved artifact completeness but missed P3 B+ mismatch by a very small margin (`0.119848` vs `0.12` lower bound).
  - Opened corrective micro-step (documented in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`):
    - keep P4 artifact wiring unchanged,
    - apply minimal S7 top-tier `home_share_min` adjustment (`0.610 -> 0.609`),
    - rerun full `segment1a-p4` and re-score P2/P3 before closure.
* 8:14AM
  - Opened M1.A implementation pass (image contract freeze).
  - Scope:
    - freeze image identity contract with explicit handle mapping,
    - mark only M1.A complete in deep plan,
    - keep M1 active for remaining sub-steps.
  - Planning-only: no image build/push execution in this pass.
* 8:15AM
  - Completed M1.A (image contract freeze) in `platform.M1.build_plan.md`.
  - Marked M1.A DoD and completion checklist as done; froze key handle mappings and immutable-tag authority posture.
  - Updated main plan with sub-phase progress: M1.A done, M1.B..M1.F pending.
  - No image build/push executed in this pass.
* 8:20AM
  - Opened M1.B closure pass for dev-substrate packaging readiness.
  - Locked scope to entrypoint matrix completion only (no image build/push execution).
  - Planned updates:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M1.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Pinned decision to map every Section 6.5 entrypoint handle to concrete module command contracts and explicit required-arg posture.
* 8:21AM
  - Implemented M1.B in deep plan:
    - added frozen handle->module entrypoint matrix,
    - expanded grouped handles (`ENTRYPOINT_RTDL_CORE_WORKER`, `ENTRYPOINT_DECISION_LANE_WORKER`) into explicit worker/service modes,
    - pinned Oracle checker path to `fraud_detection.oracle_store.cli`,
    - pinned build-go validation method (`--help` smoke + required-arg invocation checks).
  - Updated main plan sub-phase progress:
    - `M1.A` complete,
    - `M1.B` complete,
    - `M1.C..M1.F` pending.
  - Appended matching decision records to `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 8:53AM
  - Opened M1.C closure pass for dev-substrate packaging provenance/evidence contract.
  - Locked scope to docs-only contract finalization (no image build/push execution).
  - Pinned decisions:
    - use existing registry handle keys for provenance fields,
    - enforce run-scoped phase evidence path for P(-1),
    - enforce fail-closed reconciliation between ECR digest, packaging provenance artifact, and run header.
* 8:54AM
  - Implemented M1.C in `platform.M1.build_plan.md`:
    - completed provenance field contract,
    - pinned canonical run-scoped packaging provenance path,
    - added explicit mismatch fail-closed criteria,
    - added build-go validation method.
  - Updated main plan sub-phase progress in `platform.build_plan.md`:

    - M1.D..M1.F pending.
  - Appended matching decision records in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 8:55AM
  - Opened M1.D closure pass for packaging security and secret-injection contract hardening.
  - Locked to docs-only contract closure (no image build/push, no infra/runtime execution).
  - Pinned decision to enforce no-baked-secrets + fail-closed runtime secret handling using existing `dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md` secret handles.
* 8:56AM
  - Implemented M1.D in `platform.M1.build_plan.md`:
    - completed no-baked-secrets policy,
    - pinned runtime secret source/ownership contract,
    - pinned leakage and fail-closed checks,
    - pinned security evidence artifact path under `P(-1)` evidence prefix.
  - Updated `platform.build_plan.md` sub-phase progress:
    - M1.A/M1.B/M1.C/M1.D complete,
    - M1.E..M1.F pending.
  - Appended matching implementation-map entries in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 8:59AM
  - Opened combined pass per USER direction:
    - add explicit M1 deep-plan reference in `platform.build_plan.md`,
    - proceed to implement `M1.E`.
  - Logged pre-change lock in `platform.impl_actual.md` with scope and decision posture.
  - Pinned intent: M1 main plan remains status owner, while `platform.M1.build_plan.md` is explicit execution authority for pinned packaging decisions during build-go.
* 9:00AM
  - Applied USER-requested main-plan reference update:
    - active M1 section now explicitly points to `platform.M1.build_plan.md` as detailed/pinned build-go authority.
  - Completed M1.E in deep plan:
    - pinned canonical build command surface,
    - pinned required input/handle set,
    - pinned fail-closed retry/failure posture,
    - pinned command-surface receipt evidence artifact.
  - Synced main-plan progress:
    - M1.A..M1.E complete,
    - M1.F pending.
  - Appended matching implementation-map post-change closure entry.
* 9:03AM
  - Opened M1.F closure pass (exit-readiness + build-go handoff).
  - Pinned intent: close planning handoff only; do not mark M1 phase `DONE` until execution evidence exists.
* 9:04AM
  - Implemented M1.F in `platform.M1.build_plan.md`:
    - completed readiness verdict,
    - added explicit build-go handoff statement (sequence, artifacts, blockers),
    - marked M1.F complete.
  - Updated `platform.build_plan.md`:
    - M1.F marked complete in sub-phase progress,
    - final M1 checklist item marked complete,
    - explicit note added that M1 remains `ACTIVE` pending build-go execution evidence.
  - Appended matching pre/post entries in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 9:06AM
  - Executed Segment `1A` P4 full closure run:
    - `make segment1a-p4 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`,
    - run id: `8ea58c10713dab97b1234fba99c0138e`.
  - P4 artifact completeness gate passed:
    - `segment1a-p4-check` PASS,
    - all required outputs present (`s3_integerised_counts`, `s3_site_sequence`, `sparse_flag`, `merchant_abort_log`, `hurdle_stationarity_tests`).
  - Guard checks and scorecards on same run:
    - `segment1a-p2-check` PASS,
    - `segment1a-p3-check` PASS,
    - B+ mismatch/gradient posture retained.
* 9:07AM
  - Executed same-seed P4 replay:
    - `make segment1a-p4 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`,
    - replay run id: `b97f71bf357ffc8a28d80ea14894d6c4`.
  - Replay checks:
    - `segment1a-p4-check` PASS,
    - `segment1a-p2-check` PASS,
    - `segment1a-p3-check` PASS,
    - B+ posture retained (`mismatch=0.12195`, `gradient=13.4246`).
  - Replay note:
    - seed and parameter hash are unchanged, but exact row counts shifted slightly versus the prior run; score/gate posture remained accepted.
* 9:08AM
  - Storage hygiene for P4:
    - pruned superseded intermediate run folders:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/19e251361b0b1bfb185f315e91ee07fa`,
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/88f25773570789073bcf8413225b1dda`.
    - retained P4 authority pair:
      - `8ea58c10713dab97b1234fba99c0138e`,
      - `b97f71bf357ffc8a28d80ea14894d6c4`.
  - Documentation updates:
    - marked P4 phased DoDs complete in `segment_1A.build_plan.md`,
    - added P4 closure record (runs, checks, non-regression, pruning),
    - appended implementation decision trail in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 9:06AM
  - Opened M1 build-go execution pass (P(-1)) after M1.F planning closure.
  - Created execution context:
    - `runs/dev_substrate/m1_build_go/20260213T090637Z/context.json`
    - reserved packaging run scope `platform_20260213T090637Z`.
  - Planned fail-closed execution sequence: ECR preflight -> build/push/digest -> entrypoint smoke -> secret checks -> evidence write.
* 9:10AM
  - Build-go execution hit a hard contract blocker: no root `Dockerfile` exists while `IMAGE_DOCKERFILE_PATH` is pinned to `Dockerfile`.
  - Recorded blocker and resolution decision in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Next action: add root Dockerfile + .dockerignore, then rerun canonical build/push flow fail-closed.
* 9:12AM
  - Opened Segment `1A` replay determinism hardening mini-pass before P5.
  - Root cause isolated:
    - RNG master-material in stochastic states is keyed by `manifest_fingerprint`,
    - `manifest_fingerprint` changed between accepted P4 runs because `git_commit_hex` changed,
    - same `seed + parameter_hash` therefore produced different RNG streams.
  - Planned patch scope:
    - re-key Segment `1A` RNG master-material calls to `parameter_hash` for `S1/S2/S4/S6/S7/S8`,
    - preserve provenance fields (`manifest_fingerprint`) for audit,
    - rerun P4 + replay, then re-check P2/P3 non-regression and artifact completeness.
* 9:48AM
  - Implemented determinism hardening patch in Segment `1A` RNG path:
    - `s1_hurdle/rng.py` (`derive_master_material` generalized to seed-material bytes),
    - stochastic runner callsites switched from `manifest_fingerprint` to `parameter_hash` in:
      - `s1_hurdle/runner.py`,
      - `s2_nb_outlets/runner.py`,
      - `s4_ztp/runner.py`,
      - `s6_foreign_set/runner.py`,
      - `s7_integerisation/runner.py`,
      - `s8_outlet_catalogue/runner.py`.
  - Compile guard:
    - `python -m py_compile` passed for all touched modules.
* 9:49AM
  - Executed forced-manifest replay proof with fixed seed/params:
    - run A: `ENGINE_GIT_COMMIT=111...` -> `run_id=29bdb537f5aac75aa48479272fc18161`,
    - run B: `ENGINE_GIT_COMMIT=222...` -> `run_id=a1753dc8ed8fb1703b336bd4a869f361`.
  - Both runs passed:
    - `segment1a-p4-check`,
    - `segment1a-p2-check`,
    - `segment1a-p3-check`.
  - Determinism evidence:
    - S1 `is_multi` flips across A/B = `0`,
    - `s3_candidate_set`, `s3_integerised_counts`, `s6_membership`, `s3_site_sequence`, `outlet_catalogue` rows/key-sets identical across A/B.
  - Score posture:
    - P2 globals identical,
    - P3 globals identical and still in B+ mismatch/gradient bands.
* 9:50AM
  - Storage hygiene after determinism hardening:
    - pruned superseded P4 authority pair:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/8ea58c10713dab97b1234fba99c0138e`,
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/b97f71bf357ffc8a28d80ea14894d6c4`.
    - retained hardened P4 authority pair:
      - `29bdb537f5aac75aa48479272fc18161`,
      - `a1753dc8ed8fb1703b336bd4a869f361`.
* 10:04AM
  - Executed one additional Segment `1A` P4 run without forced git override for normal provenance authority:
    - `run_id=416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8`.
  - Validation:
    - `segment1a-p4-check` PASS,
    - `segment1a-p2-check` PASS,
    - `segment1a-p3-check` PASS.
  - Score posture on operational authority run:
    - P2 globals pass and match hardened pair,
    - P3 remains B+ (`mismatch=0.12012186988844974`, `gradient=12.464219959390816`).
* 10:06AM
  - Opened P5 certification execution pass.
  - Planned outputs:
    - certification-grade report with hard-gate decisions and B/B+ band coverage,
    - explicit ablation evidence stitched from P1/P2/P3/P4 authority runs,
    - alternate-seed full-run sensitivity evidence.
  - Operational plan:
    - add deterministic P5 scorer script under `tools/`,
    - run one alternate-seed (`seed=43`) full `segment1a-p4`,
    - immediately restore `config/layer1/1A/rng/run_seed.yaml` to `seed=42`,
    - finalize P5 DoD status in build plan and implementation notes.
* 9:51AM
  - Applied USER correction posture for packaging scope.
  - Opened corrective pass to enforce strict platform-only allowlist context for Docker image.
  - Explicitly removed planned engine source copy from image inputs and switched install strategy away from `pip install .`.
* 9:55AM
  - Reopened and reclosed M1.A with an explicit image content manifest (exact include set + explicit exclusions).
  - Added hard rule in M1.A: `COPY . .` is forbidden for M1 execution.
  - Aligned M1.E required inputs to enforce M1.A manifest compliance.
  - Updated main plan sub-phase note to capture M1.A reopen/reclose status.
* 10:02AM
  - Updated M1.A required include paths for data-engine interface pack to exact runtime-required files only.
  - Removed broad recursive `interface_pack` include from the pinned image manifest in `platform.M1.build_plan.md`.
  - Logged the decision in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 10:11AM
  - Added binding fail-closed decision-completeness law for "proceed" semantics.
  - Updated:
    - `AGENTS.md` (global agent law),
    - `platform.build_plan.md` (execution gate rule `10.2`).
  - Logged implementation-map entry documenting rationale and effect.
* 10:16AM
  - Restructured M1 sub-phases per USER direction.
  - Added new `M1.F` = Build Driver Authority Pin.
  - Renamed prior exit-readiness step to `M1.G` and aligned progress/checklist references.
  - Pinned driver authority in M1.F: `github_actions` authoritative, `local_cli` preflight-only.
* 10:26AM
  - Replanned M1 to add explicit missing pre-build-go phases.
  - Added:
    - `M1.G` authoritative CI workflow realization,
    - `M1.H` authoritative CI gate validation,
    - `M1.I` exit-readiness review (shifted from previous G).
  - Reopened M1 readiness by setting `M1.G..M1.I` pending and blocking build-go until they close.
* 10:31AM
  - Added learning-capture entry in `platform.impl_actual.md` documenting build-driver confusion resolution and lessons.
  - Captured clarified roles of `github_actions` (authoritative) vs `local_cli` (preflight/debug) and why pre-build-go CI phases were introduced.
* 10:32AM
  - P5 execution review found a scorer wiring defect:
    - `score_segment1a_p5_certification.py` was loading P3 authority metrics using `p4_authority_run`.
  - Opened corrective mini-pass:
    - patch scorer to use `p3_authority_run` for P3 report lookup,
    - rerun compile guard and regenerate P5 certification artifact.
* 10:35AM
  - P5 scorer compatibility fix opened:
    - identity-semantics pass flag extraction missed current P3 schema path (`metrics.global.checks.no_unexplained_duplicate_anomalies`).
  - Corrective action planned:
    - normalize extraction across current + legacy report shapes,
    - regenerate `segment1a_p5_certification.json`.
* 10:35AM
  - Opened M1.G execution-control pass per USER direction (`proceed with M1.G`).
  - Locked scope to authoritative CI workflow realization only:
    - create pinned workflow file,
    - sync M1 deep/main plan status,
    - no build-go execution yet.
* 10:37AM
  - Implemented M1.G authoritative CI workflow:
    - added `.github/workflows/dev_min_m1_packaging.yml`.
    - trigger posture pinned to `workflow_dispatch`.
    - permission posture pinned to least privilege (`contents: read`, `id-token: write`) with AWS OIDC role assumption.
    - canonical sequence implemented:
      - auth -> immutable build -> immutable push -> digest resolve -> optional convenience tag.
    - workflow outputs pinned:
      - `image_tag`, `image_digest`, `git_sha`, `ci_run_id`, `build_actor`.
    - CI artifact pack emitted under:
      - `evidence/runs/<platform_run_id>/P(-1)/`
      - with `build_command_surface_receipt.json`, `packaging_provenance.json`, `ci_m1_outputs.json`.
  - Synced plan status:
    - `platform.M1.build_plan.md`: M1.G DoD and completion checkbox marked complete with realization record.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M1.G marked complete; build-go block narrowed to pending `M1.H..M1.I`.
* 10:40AM
  - Opened M1.H closure pass.
  - Found blocking gap before closure:
    - workflow did not emit `security_secret_injection_checks.json`, which is required by M1.H evidence contract.
  - Decision:
    - patch workflow to include security evidence artifact emission,
    - add deterministic local CI contract validator to produce objective M1.H pass/fail evidence.
* 10:41AM
  - Patched workflow:
    - `.github/workflows/dev_min_m1_packaging.yml` now emits `security_secret_injection_checks.json` under `evidence/runs/<platform_run_id>/P(-1)/`.
  - Added validator:
    - `tools/dev_substrate/validate_m1_ci_workflow_contract.py`.
  - Ran M1.H validation:
    - first report FAIL due validator YAML `on` key normalization bug:
      - `runs/dev_substrate/m1_h_validation/20260213T104041Z/ci_gate_validation_report.json`
    - patched validator and reran PASS:
      - `runs/dev_substrate/m1_h_validation/20260213T104101Z/ci_gate_validation_report.json`
  - Synced plan status:
    - `platform.M1.build_plan.md`: M1.H marked complete with validation record.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M1.H marked complete; build-go block now only `M1.I`.
* 10:42AM
  - Re-ran `M1.H` validator after documentation sync for confidence check.
  - PASS report:
    - `runs/dev_substrate/m1_h_validation/20260213T104213Z/ci_gate_validation_report.json`.
  - Validator script compile guard:
    - `python -m py_compile tools/dev_substrate/validate_m1_ci_workflow_contract.py` (PASS).
* 10:45AM
  - Opened M1.I closure pass (exit-readiness review + build-go handoff finalization).
  - Review basis:
    - `platform.M1.build_plan.md`,
    - `platform.build_plan.md`,
    - M1.H validator PASS report.
  - Findings:
    - M1.A..M1.H complete and evidenced,
    - no unresolved contract ambiguity,
    - known build-go preflight prerequisites are explicit (Dockerfile path, dispatch inputs, OIDC/ECR access).
* 10:47AM
  - Closed M1.I in planning docs:
    - `platform.M1.build_plan.md`: M1.I DoD all checked, readiness verdict pinned `READY_FOR_BUILD_GO`, handoff statement marked authoritative.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M1.I marked complete, M1 handoff checklist item marked complete, immediate-next-action updated to explicit USER build-go execution path.
* 10:52AM
  - M1 build-go execution started on explicit USER direction.
  - Authoritative lane inputs resolved:
    - workflow: `.github/workflows/dev_min_m1_packaging.yml`,
    - ref: `migrate-dev`,
    - region: `eu-west-2`,
    - role: `arn:aws:iam::230372904534:role/GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction`,
    - ECR: `fraud-platform-dev-min` (`230372904534.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fraud-platform-dev-min`).
  - Preflight found Dockerfile missing (`IMAGE_DOCKERFILE_PATH=Dockerfile`), expected to fail until corrected.
* 10:56AM
  - Attempted authoritative workflow dispatch:
    - `gh workflow run dev_min_m1_packaging.yml --ref migrate-dev ...`
  - Result: HTTP 404 because workflow is not present on default branch (`main`).
  - Added missing build artifacts required by M1.A/M1.I preflight:
    - `Dockerfile` (pinned include-only copy surfaces),
    - `.dockerignore` (allowlist context; no wildcard repo copy posture).
  - Local Docker preflight build attempted and failed due local Docker daemon ping failure (`dockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping` 500). This does not override authoritative CI requirement.
  - Current blocker remains: authoritative workflow must exist on default branch before `workflow_dispatch` can be used.
* 11:35AM
  - Resumed M1 build-go after USER confirmed workflow publication.
  - Preflight passed:
    - `dev-min-m1-packaging` workflow is active and viewable,
    - `Dockerfile` exists at pinned path,
    - AWS caller identity and ECR repo handles resolve.
  - Next action: dispatch authoritative workflow on `migrate-dev` and monitor to terminal status.
* 11:36AM
  - Build-go dispatch attempt A:
    - run: `21985402789` (ref `migrate-dev`).
  - Failed fail-closed at OIDC:
    - AWS account missing provider for `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
* 11:38AM
  - Created IAM OIDC provider:
    - `arn:aws:iam::230372904534:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
  - Dispatched attempt B on trust-allowed ref `dev`:
    - run: `21985472266`.
  - Failed fail-closed at ECR login:
    - role missing `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`.
* 11:40AM
  - Added inline role policy `GitHubActionsEcrPushDevMin` to role `GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction`:
    - auth token action on `*`,
    - ECR push/read actions scoped to `fraud-platform-dev-min` repo ARN.
  - Dispatched attempt C on `dev`:
    - run: `21985500168`.
* 11:41AM
  - Attempt C succeeded:
    - run URL: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/21985500168`.
  - Captured immutable image identity:
    - tag `git-799d398a7daf34857cf363c9a1a629c40ec25d5e`,
    - digest `sha256:d71cbe335ec0ced59a40721f0e1f6016b276ec17f34e52708d3fd02c04d79f56`.
* 11:42AM
  - Downloaded CI artifact pack to:
    - `runs/dev_substrate/m1_build_go/20260213T114002Z/`.
  - Uploaded P(-1) evidence to S3:
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T114002Z/P(-1)/`.
  - Verified required evidence objects exist:
    - `build_command_surface_receipt.json`,
    - `packaging_provenance.json`,
    - `security_secret_injection_checks.json`.
* 12:02PM
  - Added first-time operator explanatory evidence note for M1 build-go:
    - where compute actually ran (local control plane vs GitHub build plane),
    - where image landed (ECR immutable tag+digest),
    - where evidence landed (GitHub artifacts + local mirror + S3 run path),
    - fail-closed failed-run history and remediations.
  - Files updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`,
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M1.build_plan.md` (pointer to the narrative entry).
* 10:36AM
  - Closed Segment `1A` P5 execution.
  - Alternate-seed sensitivity evidence:
    - set `run_seed.yaml` to `43`, executed full `segment1a-p4`, run `651fa96a4dc46cbcf6e3cfee8434180f`, then restored seed to `42`.
    - generated:
      - `segment1a_p2_1_baseline_651fa96a4dc46cbcf6e3cfee8434180f.json`,
      - `segment1a_p3_1_baseline_651fa96a4dc46cbcf6e3cfee8434180f.json`.
  - P5 scorer finalized:
    - added `tools/score_segment1a_p5_certification.py`,
    - fixed P3 authority lookup wiring,
    - fixed identity-semantics compatibility extraction.
  - Final certification artifact:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p5_certification.json`.
  - Grade decision:
    - hard gates `4/4` pass,
    - `B` coverage `13/14` (`0.9286`),
    - `B+` coverage `10/14` (`0.7143`),
    - final grade `B`.
* 10:44AM
  - Opened P5 B+ recovery mini-pass with fail-safe rollback posture per USER direction.
  - Scoped targets and control knobs:
    - P1 bundle (hurdle/NB coeffs) for `top10` + `gini`,
    - deferred S4/S6/S7 knobs for `rho` + `spread` unless needed.
  - Decision:
    - attempt P1-only recovery first (fast S0->S2 loops),
    - only promote to full P4/P5 if P1 concentration targets are met,
    - revert to current authority bundle immediately on grade regression.
* 10:56AM
  - Completed P5 B+ recovery mini-pass (P1 concentration sweep).
  - Findings:
    - no tested bundle variant satisfied both B+ concentration constraints (`top10>=0.38` and `gini<=0.58`) together,
    - reductions in `gini` consistently pulled `top10` below threshold.
  - Applied user fail-safe decision:
    - rollback experimental bundle edits,
    - prune exploratory run-id folders,
    - retain current Segment `1A` certified `B` posture.
* 11:00AM
  - Segment `1A` remediation is frozen at certified grade `B` (authority artifact retained; no further tuning changes in 1A active path).
* 12:28PM
  - Started Segment `1B` remediation planning pass (data-first posture).
  - Published new build plan:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`.
  - Added implementation decision-trail entries for this planning action:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.
  - Plan content includes:
    - progressive state rerun matrix,
    - heavy-compute fast-lane vs certification-lane protocol,
    - phased `P0..P5` remediation with DoDs and phase-freeze rules.
* 12:32PM
  - Expanded Segment `1B` `P0` in build plan to execution-ready detail:
    - added `P0.1..P0.5` sub-phases,
    - baseline authority + lineage pin requirements,
    - baseline scorecard and checkpoint artifact requirements (`S2`, `S4`, `S6/S8`),
    - run retention/prune discipline and explicit `P0 -> P1` go/no-go gate.
  - Updated decision trail with pre/post entries:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:52PM
  - Executed Segment `1B` `P0` end-to-end and closed phase gate.
  - Added reproducible baseline scorer:
    - `tools/score_segment1b_p0_baseline.py`.
  - Generated baseline authority artifacts (run `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`):
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p0_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p0_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92_country_share.csv`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p0_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92_region_share.csv`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p0_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92_nn_quantiles.csv`.
  - Activated 1B harness folders/pointers:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/baseline_authority/baseline_pointer.json`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/current_candidate/README.txt`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/last_good/last_good_pointer.json`,
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/iteration_protocol.json`.
  - Ran prune-before-run flow for 1B root and captured evidence:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p0_prune_check.txt`.
  - Updated build plan DoDs to closed and recorded `P0 -> P1` decision:
    - go/no-go = `GO`.
* 12:48PM
  - Expanded Segment `1B` `P1` plan in block style (no `P1.1` numbering):
    - added `P1-A..P1-E` work blocks,
    - added explicit S2 scope boundary for P1,
    - added concrete file surfaces, knob map, and expanded DoD criteria.
  - Updated decision trail entries:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:33PM
  - Expanded platform dev-substrate M2 planning surfaces to avoid M1-style under-specification drift.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M2.build_plan.md`
  - M2 updates include:
    - `M2` activated in main roadmap and decomposed into `M2.A..M2.J`,
    - binding anti-cram law (`Phase-Coverage Law`) pinned in main plan,
    - deep M2 lane-coverage matrix + DoD/checkpoint surfaces added.
* 12:34PM
  - Hardened `platform.M2.build_plan.md` with runbook/registry-aligned detail:
    - explicit required-handle families and key sets for M2.A closure,
    - canonical command-lane requirements for state/SSM/topic checks,
    - explicit evidence root contract and artifact list for M2 execution,
    - unresolved-blocker register (must be empty before execution).
  - Added post-change decision trail entry:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:36PM
  - Opened M2.A execution pass (`Substrate Authority + Handle Closure Matrix`) per USER direction.
  - Preflight gate:
    - verified all M2.A minimum required keys exist in registry.
    - result: `TOTAL_KEYS=46`, `ALL_PRESENT`.
  - Logged pre-change lock in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:41PM
  - Completed M2.A planning closure work.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M2.build_plan.md` with:
    - explicit M2.A closure summary (`46` keys, unknown=`0`),
    - verification command catalog (`V1..V11`),
    - secret-surface separation rule,
    - per-key closure matrix covering all required M2.A handles.
  - Synced status surfaces:
    - `platform.M2.build_plan.md`: M2.A DoD complete + M2 checklist `M2.A` checked.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M2 sub-phase tracker marks `M2.A` done; immediate next action now `M2.B`.
  - No substrate mutation commands executed in this pass.
* 12:44PM
  - USER requested anti-cram law to be pinned in repository-level `AGENTS.md`.
  - Opened pre-change lock in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:45PM
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` under `2.5 Drift Sentinel Law` with:
    - `Phase-coverage law (anti-cram, fail-closed)`.
  - Law now requires:
    - explicit capability-lane exposure before phase execution,
    - dynamic phase/sub-phase expansion (no fixed-count cramming),
    - fail-closed pause + unresolved-item escalation on discovered holes.
  - Added post-change decision-trail entry:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:47PM
  - Started M2.B execution pass (`Terraform Backend/State Partition Readiness`).
  - Entry blocker found:
    - pinned stack roots `infra/terraform/dev_min/core|demo` did not exist in filesystem.
  - Decision:
    - materialize canonical stack roots at pinned paths using existing Terraform modules before readiness validation.
* 12:55PM
  - Completed M2.B with live evidence-backed checks.
  - Implemented canonical stack roots:
    - `infra/terraform/dev_min/core/*`
    - `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo/*`
  - Ran validation command surface:
    - `terraform fmt -recursive infra/terraform/dev_min infra/terraform/modules` (PASS),
    - core/demo `init -backend=false` + `validate` (PASS),
    - core/demo `init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend.hcl.example` (PASS).
  - Ran live AWS controls:
    - tfstate bucket (`fraud-platform-dev-min-tfstate`) versioning/public-access-block/encryption checks (PASS),
    - lock table (`fraud-platform-dev-min-tf-locks`) readiness check (PASS).
  - Evidence written:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_b/20260213T125421Z/m2_b_backend_state_readiness_snapshot.json`
    - S3: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T125421Z/m2_b_backend_state_readiness_snapshot.json`
  - Status sync:
    - `platform.M2.build_plan.md`: M2.B DoD complete + closure summary/evidence.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M2.B marked complete; immediate next action moved to M2.C.
* 1:00PM
  - Started M2.C implementation pass (`Core Apply Closure Contract`).
  - Scope locked to contract/evidence implementation only:
    - no `apply`,
    - no `destroy`,
    - no manual console mutation.
* 1:05PM
  - Completed M2.C contract closure implementation and evidence capture.
  - Added to `platform.M2.build_plan.md`:
    - canonical core command surface,
    - explicit acceptance checks,
    - evidence schema/path contract,
    - rollback/correction posture,
    - M2.C closure summary + evidence refs.
  - Evidence produced:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_c/20260213T130431Z/m2_c_core_apply_contract_snapshot.json`
    - S3: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T130431Z/m2_c_core_apply_contract_snapshot.json`
  - Material blocker pinned:
    - `M2C-B1`: core state key empty while core resources already exist (requires controlled state import/migration before first core apply).
  - Status sync:
    - `platform.M2.build_plan.md`: M2.C marked complete (contract closure).
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M2.C checked; immediate next action changed to close `M2C-B1` then proceed to M2.D.
* 1:09PM
  - Corrective recovery during M2.C pass:
    - while deleting accidental `$plan` artifact, core stack files were unintentionally removed by shell expansion.
  - Immediate fix applied:
    - restored `infra/terraform/dev_min/core/*` canonical files,
    - re-ran `terraform init -backend=false` and `terraform validate` for core stack (PASS).
  - Net: no `apply`/`destroy` executed; core stack returned to valid state.
* 1:22PM
  - Resolved blocker `M2C-B1` (core state mismatch) via controlled Terraform state import/migration.
  - Root-cause fix for importability:
    - `infra/terraform/modules/core/main.tf`
      - changed dependent `for_each` from resource-derived to static key map (`local.bucket_names`).
    - `infra/terraform/modules/core/outputs.tf`
      - made `bucket_names` output import-safe with key-driven `try(...)` mapping.
  - Imported core resources into state (24 total), then re-planned:
    - post-import `CREATE_COUNT=0` (closure criterion met).
  - Evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_c/20260213T132116Z/m2c_b1_resolution_snapshot.json`
    - S3: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T132116Z/m2c_b1_resolution_snapshot.json`
  - Status/docs sync:
    - `platform.M2.build_plan.md`: moved `M2C-B1` to resolved blocker record.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: immediate next action now proceeds to M2.D.
* 1:29PM
  - Executed `M2.D` demo-apply closure contract checks (fail-closed posture).
  - Command surface executed:
    - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_min/demo init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend.hcl.example` (PASS),
    - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_min/demo validate` (PASS),
    - `terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/dev_min/demo plan -out demo.apply.plan` + `terraform show -json` (PASS).
  - Evidence generated:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_d/20260213T132643Z/m2_d_demo_apply_contract_snapshot.json`,
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T132643Z/m2_d_demo_apply_contract_snapshot.json`.
  - Material finding:
    - current demo plan includes only `aws_cloudwatch_log_group`, `aws_s3_object`, and heartbeat-only `aws_ssm_parameter`.
    - required demo capability lanes are missing: Confluent cluster/topics, ECS scaffolding, runtime DB, required Confluent/DB SSM secret paths.
  - Status/docs sync:
    - `platform.M2.build_plan.md`: M2.D contract sections/evidence added; `M2.D` remains open.
    - unresolved blocker register now contains `M2D-B1..M2D-B4`.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: immediate next action set to resolve `M2D-B1..M2D-B4` before closing `M2.D`.
* 1:38PM
  - Captured migration learning in implementation notes:
    - moved from UI-first setup assumption to IaC-first setup/teardown posture for dev substrate migration.
  - Learning rationale logged:
    - deterministic repeatability across reruns,
    - clean teardown and lower resource residue risk,
    - reduced console drift,
    - stronger auditability through plan/apply/evidence artifacts.
  - Fail-closed implication pinned:
    - if a required capability is not representable in IaC command lanes, it is treated as an explicit blocker/decision item, not an implicit manual step.
* 1:43PM
  - Opened M2.D blocker-closure implementation pass for `M2D-B1..M2D-B4`.
  - Scope locked:
    - expand demo Terraform stack to include missing capability lanes (Confluent contract surfaces, ECS scaffolding, runtime DB, canonical SSM path writes),
    - regenerate M2.D plan evidence and update blocker register/status docs.
  - Boundary pinned:
    - no `terraform apply`/`destroy`, no console mutation.
* 1:49PM
  - Closed M2.D blockers `M2D-B1..M2D-B4` by expanding demo Terraform substrate capabilities.
  - Infra changes implemented in `infra/terraform/modules/demo/*` and `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo/*`:
    - VPC/public subnet/SG/route scaffolding,
    - ECS cluster + roles + task-definition + desired-count-zero service,
    - Postgres RDS runtime DB + subnet group,
    - canonical SSM writes for Confluent/DB/IG paths,
    - Confluent topic catalog artifact and expanded outputs.
  - Validation:
    - `terraform fmt` PASS,
    - demo `init -reconfigure` PASS,
    - demo `validate` PASS,
    - demo `plan` PASS (29 creates),
    - `show -json` PASS.
  - New M2.D evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_d/20260213T134810Z/m2_d_demo_apply_contract_snapshot.json`,
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T134810Z/m2_d_demo_apply_contract_snapshot.json`.
  - Result:
    - snapshot `overall_pass=true`,
    - required demo categories all true,
    - `M2.D` marked complete, unresolved blocker register cleared,
    - immediate next action moved to `M2.E`.
  - Boundary note:
    - Confluent lane closure mode is contract-materialized in M2.D; live topic/connectivity/ACL validation remains in M2.F.
* 1:55PM
  - Opened M2.E execution pass (SSM secret materialization + IAM access-boundary checks).
  - Scope:
    - validate required secret paths (Confluent/DB/IG),
    - validate runtime role read boundary using IAM simulation,
    - emit non-secret evidence artifact `secret_surface_check.json`.
  - Boundary: no `terraform apply`/`destroy`, no console mutation.
* 1:58PM
  - Executed M2.E secret-surface/access checks with fail-closed posture.
  - Evidence produced:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_e/20260213T135629Z/secret_surface_check.json`,
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T135629Z/secret_surface_check.json`.
  - Findings:
    - Confluent SSM paths present,
    - DB SSM paths missing,
    - IG SSM path missing,
    - runtime roles (`fraud-platform-dev-min-ecs-task-execution`, `fraud-platform-dev-min-ecs-task-app`) missing.
  - Added Terraform IAM hardening for future closure:
    - app role least-privilege secret-read policy (`aws_iam_role_policy.ecs_task_app_secret_read`) pinned in demo module.
  - Result:
    - M2.E remains OPEN with blockers `M2E-B1` and `M2E-B2`.
    - immediate next action updated to resolve blockers, then rerun M2.E.
* 2:03PM
  - Started M2E blocker-resolution pass (`M2E-B1`, `M2E-B2`).
  - Plan:
    - run full demo apply with safe Confluent variable injection from existing SSM values,
    - materialize missing DB/IG secret paths and runtime roles,
    - rerun M2.E checks and close blockers only on `overall_pass=true`.
* 2:15PM
  - Resolved M2.E blockers (`M2E-B1`, `M2E-B2`) and closed M2.E.
  - Execution actions:
    - ran demo apply with safe Confluent secret injection from existing SSM values,
    - first apply failed on DB version (`postgres 16.3` unavailable in `eu-west-2`),
    - corrected DB defaults to `16.12`, reran apply to completion.
  - Live outcomes:
    - required DB/IG SSM paths materialized,
    - runtime roles materialized,
    - demo DB created with endpoint output.
  - M2.E evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m2_e/20260213T141419Z/secret_surface_check.json`,
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260213T141419Z/secret_surface_check.json`.
  - IAM simulation result:
    - app role allowed `6/6` pinned secret ARNs,
    - execution role allowed `0/6` (implicit deny).
  - Status sync:
    - `M2.E` marked complete,
    - blockers `M2E-B1/B2` moved to resolved,
    - immediate next action moved to `M2.F`.
* 2:19PM
  - Opened cost-guardrail hardening pass by USER request.
  - Scope:
    - write a detailed implementation-note entry for cost-accrual challenge/learning,
    - pin M2.I section ownership for cost guardrails,
    - add practical monitoring surface (dashboard + snapshot command lane) to reduce billing surprises.
* 2:23PM
  - Added detailed cost-accrual learning note to implementation map (challenge framing + management posture).
  - Key framing captured:
    - free-tier request overages are often not the dominant cost risk,
    - managed always-on resources (especially DB) are the primary surprise-bill vector,
    - Cost Explorer lag means live resource posture checks are required in parallel,
    - Confluent spend is outside AWS Cost Explorer and must be monitored separately.
  - Added practical monitoring surfaces:
    - `tools/dev_substrate/cost_guardrail_dashboard.json` (CloudWatch dashboard template),
    - `tools/dev_substrate/cost_guardrail_snapshot.py` (CE + budget + live-resource snapshot utility).
  - Updated M2 deep plan `M2.I` to include dashboard/snapshot command lane and live-cost risk checks.
* 2:33PM
  - Activated cost dashboard in AWS account:
    - command: `aws cloudwatch put-dashboard --dashboard-name fraud-platform-dev-min-cost-guardrail --dashboard-body file://tools/dev_substrate/cost_guardrail_dashboard.json`
    - result: `DashboardValidationMessages=[]` (no validation warnings).
  - Ran first snapshot capture:
    - command: `python tools/dev_substrate/cost_guardrail_snapshot.py`
    - artifact: `runs/dev_substrate/cost_guardrail/20260213T143327Z/cost_guardrail_snapshot.json`.
  - Outcome:
    - cost guardrail monitoring moved from "planned/configured" to "operational";
    - M2.I monitoring lane now executable with evidence.
