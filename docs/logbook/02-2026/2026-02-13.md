  - Opened P3 build-plan expansion task for Segment `1A`.
  - Logged pre-edit design note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to capture rationale before changing the plan.
  - Planned P3 rewrite structure:
    - freeze guardrails,
    - baseline + CI scorer,
    - identity semantics hardening,
    - legal mismatch closure under frozen upstream,
    - conditional minimal reopen protocol,
    - replay lock criteria.
* 4:34AM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md` to expand P3 into explicit execution sub-phases.
  - Added:
    - P3 freeze guardrails (protect P1/P2 locks),
    - fixed size/identity scoring choices,
    - target metric definitions + CI requirement,
    - P3.1..P3.4 DoD structure,
    - anti-forging/veto calibration method,
    - fail-closed conditional reopen protocol.
  - Appended post-edit decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
