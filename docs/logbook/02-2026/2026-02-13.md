* 4:33AM
  - Opened P3 build-plan expansion task for Segment `1A`.
  - Logged pre-edit design note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to capture rationale before changing the plan.
  - Planned P3 rewrite structure:
    - freeze guardrails,
    - baseline + CI scorer,
    - identity semantics hardening,
    - legal mismatch closure under frozen upstream,
    - conditional minimal reopen protocol,
    - replay lock criteria.
* 4:34AM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md` to expand P3 into explicit execution sub-phases.
  - Added:
    - P3 freeze guardrails (protect P1/P2 locks),
    - fixed size/identity scoring choices,
    - target metric definitions + CI requirement,
    - P3.1..P3.4 DoD structure,
    - anti-forging/veto calibration method,
    - fail-closed conditional reopen protocol.
  - Appended post-edit decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:38AM
  - Started migration-doc drift patch pass per USER instruction (four-item closure set).
  - Logged pre-change lock in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md` with scope, decisions, and validation plan.
  - Targeted files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/README.md`
* 4:39AM
  - Started Segment `1A` Phase `P3.1` execution (baseline/scoring harness).
  - Read and anchored to state/spec authorities before edits:
    - `state.1A.s8.expanded.md`,
    - `state.1A.s9.expanded.md`,
    - `schemas.1A.yaml`, `schemas.layer1.yaml`, `dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml`,
    - `segment_1A_remediation_report.md`,
    - P3 section in `segment_1A.build_plan.md`.
  - Appended pre-edit design/decision note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` describing P3.1 tooling plan (`segment1a-p3` target + verifier + scorer).
* 4:39AM
  - Applied 3-file migration-doc patch set.
  - `dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`:
    - aligned image handle key to `IMAGE_TAG_DEV_MIN_LATEST`,
    - removed stale "pin later" wording for `CONFIG_DIGEST_ALGO` and `REPORTER_LOCK_BACKEND`,
    - replaced Section 1.10 open-items block with pinned-closure status,
    - removed local-parity bootstrap allowance in P3 seed semantics.
  - `dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`:
    - set `ORACLE_SEED_OPERATOR_PRESTEP_REQUIRED = false`,
    - added anti-regression note to keep P3 seed strictly managed object-store-only.
  - `migration_to_dev/README.md`:
    - promoted from scaffold wording to authority index + working rule.
  - Ran validation grep + diff checks confirming targeted drifts are closed.
