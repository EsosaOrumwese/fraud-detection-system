* 4:33AM
  - Opened P3 build-plan expansion task for Segment `1A`.
  - Logged pre-edit design note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to capture rationale before changing the plan.
  - Planned P3 rewrite structure:
    - freeze guardrails,
    - baseline + CI scorer,
    - identity semantics hardening,
    - legal mismatch closure under frozen upstream,
    - conditional minimal reopen protocol,
    - replay lock criteria.
* 4:34AM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md` to expand P3 into explicit execution sub-phases.
  - Added:
    - P3 freeze guardrails (protect P1/P2 locks),
    - fixed size/identity scoring choices,
    - target metric definitions + CI requirement,
    - P3.1..P3.4 DoD structure,
    - anti-forging/veto calibration method,
    - fail-closed conditional reopen protocol.
  - Appended post-edit decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:38AM
  - Started migration-doc drift patch pass per USER instruction (four-item closure set).
  - Logged pre-change lock in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md` with scope, decisions, and validation plan.
  - Targeted files:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/README.md`
* 4:39AM
  - Started Segment `1A` Phase `P3.1` execution (baseline/scoring harness).
  - Read and anchored to state/spec authorities before edits:
    - `state.1A.s8.expanded.md`,
    - `state.1A.s9.expanded.md`,
    - `schemas.1A.yaml`, `schemas.layer1.yaml`, `dataset_dictionary.layer1.1A.yaml`,
    - `segment_1A_remediation_report.md`,
    - P3 section in `segment_1A.build_plan.md`.
  - Appended pre-edit design/decision note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` describing P3.1 tooling plan (`segment1a-p3` target + verifier + scorer).
* 4:39AM
  - Applied 3-file migration-doc patch set.
  - `dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`:
    - aligned image handle key to `IMAGE_TAG_DEV_MIN_LATEST`,
    - removed stale "pin later" wording for `CONFIG_DIGEST_ALGO` and `REPORTER_LOCK_BACKEND`,
    - replaced Section 1.10 open-items block with pinned-closure status,
    - removed local-parity bootstrap allowance in P3 seed semantics.
  - `dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`:
    - set `ORACLE_SEED_OPERATOR_PRESTEP_REQUIRED = false`,
    - added anti-regression note to keep P3 seed strictly managed object-store-only.
  - `migration_to_dev/README.md`:
    - promoted from scaffold wording to authority index + working rule.
  - Ran validation grep + diff checks confirming targeted drifts are closed.
* 4:42AM
  - Implemented P3.1 harness artifacts:
    - `tools/verify_segment1a_p3_outputs.py` (required P3 surfaces check),
    - `tools/score_segment1a_p3_1_baseline.py` (global/stratified metrics + CIs + duplicate diagnostics),
    - `makefile` target wiring for `segment1a-p3` / `segment1a-p3-check`.
  - Ran script/target smoke checks:
    - `py_compile` pass,
    - `--help` pass for both tools,
    - `make -n segment1a-p3-check` pass.
  - Appended implementation decision record in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:48AM
  - Ran `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A`; pipeline reached S7 then failed with `F4:E_DIRICHLET_NONPOS` (`alpha=0.0`) before S8.
  - Confirmed failure artifact at run-local `failure.json` and traced root-cause to S7 dirichlet diagnostics lane (`alpha0 * share` hard-fail on zero-share entries).
  - Logged blocker triage + planned minimal S7 robustness patch in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` before editing code.
* 4:48AM
  - Patched `S7` dirichlet diagnostics robustness in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s7_integerisation/runner.py`:
    - keep fail on non-finite/negative alpha,
    - floor zero alpha to `1e-12` to avoid `E_DIRICHLET_NONPOS` abort.
  - Ran `py_compile` on patched runner (pass).
  - Logged post-edit implementation note in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:49AM
  - Created fresh execution build plan at `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
  - Plan now includes:
    - scope/authority lock,
    - non-negotiable migration guardrails,
    - progressive-elaboration rules,
    - canonical roadmap (M0..M10 mapped to P(-1), P0..P12),
    - detailed active phase (`M0`) with DoD checklist,
    - transition checklist and next action.
  - Appended matching pre/post decision trail entries in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 4:58AM
  - Audited fresh `platform.build_plan.md` against `dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md` gate/evidence posture.
  - Found structure sound but grouped phase DoDs (M6/M7/M9/M10) were too compressed for safe execution interpretation.
  - Opened targeted hardening patch to increase runbook DoD fidelity while keeping plan high-level.
* 5:00AM
  - Applied pre-commit hardening pass on `platform.build_plan.md` after runbook fidelity review.
  - Tightened grouped DoD summaries (M2..M10) to explicitly reflect key runbook gates/evidence surfaces.
  - Added `9.1 High-Level Evidence Fidelity Map` linking each plan phase to minimum evidence families.
  - Confirmed progressive-elaboration model remains intact (single active phase, gated transitions).
* 5:06AM
  - Opened build-plan hardening pass to move certification from count-only (20/200) to two-layer validation:
    - Semantic Green (20/200 smoke for laws/gates),
    - Scale Green (representative window + burst + soak + recovery under load).
  - Target file: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`.
* 5:06AM
  - Applied build-plan certification upgrade from count-only to two-layer model:
    - Semantic Green (20/200 law-gate smoke),
    - Scale Green (representative-window, burst, soak, recovery under load).
  - Updated M10 roadmap label, M10 DoD, and evidence mapping.
  - Added `9.2 Scale-Green Threshold Pinning Rule` with explicit rule: 20/200 alone cannot close M10.
* 5:10AM
  - Recorded user-pinned validation posture:
    - 20/200 is semantic smoke only,
    - dev certification requires Scale Green (representative-window, burst, soak, recovery),
    - cannot claim dev-green on count-capped runs alone.
  - Linked enforcement to build-plan sections (Global DoD, M10, 9.2 threshold pinning rule).
* 5:16AM
  - Opened planning-structure pass to support per-phase deep docs (`platform.M*.md`) with main plan retained as status control hub.
  - Scope for this pass:
    - expand `platform.build_plan.md` routing/ownership rules,
    - create `platform.M0.build_plan.md` deep plan,
    - planning only (no build/infra execution).
* 5:17AM
  - Applied planning-structure update:
    - main plan expanded with deep-phase routing + status ownership,
    - created `platform.M0.build_plan.md` for detailed M0 planning,
    - updated dev_substrate README to reflect the new pattern.
  - Confirmed this pass remains planning-only (no runtime build execution).
* 5:22AM
  - Opened M0 closure pass (governance implementation only).
  - Planned outcomes:
    - finalize missing M0 governance artifacts,
    - mark M0 checklists complete,
    - set M0 closed in roadmap,
    - keep M1 pending explicit user activation.
* 5:22AM
  - Completed M0 implementation as a full governance closure.
  - Main plan updates:
    - M0 set to `DONE`,
    - M1 kept `NOT_STARTED` pending explicit user activation,
    - added phase evidence template section,
    - added user-governed transition authority rule.
  - M0 deep plan updates:
    - all sub-DoD and completion checklists marked complete,
    - added closure snapshot with evidence references.
  - No runtime/infra build execution performed in this pass.
* 5:38AM
  - Activated next-phase planning step:
    - set `M1` as active in main plan,
    - author deep M1 plan doc (`platform.M1.build_plan.md`),
    - keep this pass planning-only (no image/infra execution).
* 5:39AM
  - Activated M1 in main build plan and created `platform.M1.build_plan.md` deep plan.
  - Updated README to reflect M0 closed and M1 active deep-plan file.
  - This pass remained planning-only; no image build/push or infra/runtime execution was started.
* 5:51AM
  - Stopped the stuck `segment1a-p3` run process chain for run-id `ddc8e46d9e25fe160800ad878d1fa8c9` after observing S7 dirichlet pathological runtime.
  - Replaced the interim S7 alpha-floor patch with a corrective strategy:
    - skip dirichlet payload emission for merchants with any nonpositive share,
    - keep deterministic integerisation/residual-rank path active,
    - keep strict invalid-alpha checks inside payload generation.
  - Re-ran `py_compile` on the S7 runner (pass).
  - Appended corrective decision trail in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 5:56AM
  - Completed `make segment1a-p3 RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A` successfully after S7 corrective patch.
  - P3.1 baseline run-id: `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147`.
  - Baseline report written:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147.json`.
  - Key global baseline outcomes:
    - `home_legal_mismatch_rate=0.3971` (fails B/B+),
    - `size_gradient_pp=+1.84pp` (fails B/B+),
    - unexplained duplicate anomalies = `0` (pass).
  - Updated build-plan P3.1 DoD checkboxes to complete and added run/report evidence line.
  - Pruned interrupted run folder `ddc8e46d9e25fe160800ad878d1fa8c9` to control storage.
  - Appended full closure entry to `segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.
* 5:57AM
  - Cleaned P3 score script warning: switched Polars `with_row_count` -> `with_row_index` in `tools/score_segment1a_p3_1_baseline.py`.
  - Re-ran `py_compile` for the script (pass).
* 5:58AM
  - Re-ran P3 scorecard tool on run `d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147` after warning cleanup to refresh report output and confirm no runtime warning.
  - Report path unchanged:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_p3_1_baseline_d94f908cd5715404af1bfb9792735147.json`.
