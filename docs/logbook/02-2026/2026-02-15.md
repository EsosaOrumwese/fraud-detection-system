* 12:12AM
  - Opened execution lock for `M5.F` after `M5.E` functional-green PASS.
  - Pinned managed-checker closure path:
    - run `TD_ORACLE_CHECKER` as managed one-shot with command override for real per-output checks,
    - enforce fail-closed semantics (`overall_pass=false` on any output failure),
    - publish `oracle/checker_pass.json` to durable evidence and mirror locally.
  - Logged detailed rationale and execution intent in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 12:15AM
  - First `M5.F` managed checker execution failed fail-closed.
  - Root cause from CloudWatch:
    - `s3:PutObject AccessDenied` for `evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/oracle/checker_pass.json`
    - role: `fraud-platform-dev-min-rtdl-core`.
  - Classified blocker: `M5F-B3` (checker pass artifact write failure).
* 12:17AM
  - Patched IAM policy source in `infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf` to grant RTDL core lane evidence-prefix write/read on `evidence/runs/*`.
  - Applied demo Terraform with run-id pin:
    - `required_platform_run_id=platform_20260213T214223Z`.
* 12:19AM
  - Detected drift during apply: daemon/oracle task definitions reverted to `busybox` image (no python runtime) because `ecs_daemon_container_image` was not supplied in apply invocation.
  - Immediate corrective action:
    - reapplied demo Terraform with pinned ECR digest:
      - `ecs_daemon_container_image=230372904534.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fraud-platform-dev-min@sha256:d71cbe335ec0ced59a40721f0e1f6016b276ec17f34e52708d3fd02c04d79f56`.
* 12:21AM
  - Reran `M5.F` managed checker and closed PASS.
  - Artifacts:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m5/20260215T002040Z/checker_pass.json`

    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - M5 status now `DONE`; M6 entry handoff published and ready.
* 02:01AM
  - Opened pre-change planning lock for M6 expansion.
  - Planned docs scope:
    - update `platform.build_plan.md` to activate and expand M6 planning posture from M5 handoff,
    - create `platform.M6.build_plan.md` with closure-grade `P4..P7` deep plan (`M6.A..M6.I`).
  - Logged full planning rationale/authority set in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 02:04AM
  - Completed M6 planning expansion.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - roadmap/status switched to `M5 DONE`, `M6 ACTIVE`,

  - Appended post-change decision trail entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 02:06AM
  - Opened pre-change planning lock for `M6.A` expansion.
  - Scope pinned:
    - expand `M6.A` in `platform.M6.build_plan.md` to execution-grade closure detail (inputs, probes, schema, blockers),
    - reflect `M6.A` expansion-state note in `platform.build_plan.md`.
* 02:08AM
  - Completed `M6.A` planning expansion.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M6.build_plan.md`:
    - expanded `M6.A` with explicit required inputs, handle-closure matrix, materialization probes, policy pin checks, snapshot schema, and stronger fail-closed blocker taxonomy.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - added M6 expansion-state note that `M6.A` is execution-grade and is the immediate gate.
  - Appended post-change decision entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 02:21AM
  - Opened execution lock for `M6.A`.
  - Pinned execution scope:
    - validate M5->M6 handoff invariants,
    - build required-handle closure matrix for `P4..P7`,
    - run ECS/SSM/topic/pattern probes without exposing secret values,
    - enforce policy pins (`IG_AUTH_MODE=api_key`, `WSP_STOP_ON_NONRETRYABLE=true`),
    - publish `m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json` local + durable.
* 02:30AM
  - Executed `M6.A` handle-closure probe and published authoritative snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T022859Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T022859Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed (`overall_pass=false`) with blocker `M6A-B2`.
  - Unresolved required handles:
    - `IG_BASE_URL`, `TD_SR`, `TD_WSP`, `ROLE_SR_TASK`, `ROLE_WSP_TASK`.
  - Policy-pin checks passed:
    - `IG_AUTH_MODE=api_key`
    - `WSP_STOP_ON_NONRETRYABLE=true`
  - Updated planning docs to record M6.A execution evidence and blocker-closure criteria.
* 02:31AM
  - Data-engine `1B` remediation lane resumed on candidate run `9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306`.
  - Ran `S4` with fast-compute-safe cache controls:
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_COUNTRIES_MAX=48`
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_MAX_BYTES=2500000000`
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_RANK_CACHE_ENTRIES_MAX=128`
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_RANK_CACHE_BYTES_MAX=67108864`
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_RANK_CACHE_K_MAX=200000`
  - `S4` completed in ~2280s with `rows_emitted=102340`, `unique_countries=183`.
* 02:32AM
  - Ran proxy scorer `tools/score_segment1b_p4r3_proxy.py` for wave-4.
  - Proxy dropped the candidate due lineage resolution failure:
    - missing upstream file `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/f50074ae643103bf0bae832555a4605a/run_receipt.json`
    - cause: upstream `1A` run referenced by wave-4 summary had been pruned.
  - Recorded this as storage/lineage coupling risk for P4.R6.
* 02:33AM
  - Executed full closure chain on same run-id:
    - `segment1b-s5`, `segment1b-s6`, `segment1b-s7`, `segment1b-s8`, `segment1b-s9` all completed (`S9 PASS`).
  - Ran integrated scorer:
    - `tools/score_segment1b_p4_integrated.py --candidate-run-id 9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306`
    - artifact: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306.json`
  - Result: `RED_REOPEN_REQUIRED` (still below B/B+).
  - Primary blockers remained:
    - concentration (`country_gini`, `top10_share`, `top5_share`),
    - coverage (`eligible_country_nonzero_share`, `southern_hemisphere_share`),
    - NN contraction gate.
  - Updated decision trail docs:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
* 06:53AM
  - Confirmed Segment 1B current-best vs baseline `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`:
    - concentration improved (`gini/top10/top5/top1` all better),
    - coverage improved (`eligible_country_nonzero_share`, `southern_hemisphere_share`, active countries),
    - NN tail ratio worsened (`nn_p99/p50` higher).
  - Recorded explicit decision to stop active 1B remediation and move to Segment 2A:
    - mark 1B as `best-effort improved` and `below B/B+ certification`,
    - do not claim B/B+ for 1B in this pass.
  - Updated docs with transition/deferred-scope clarity:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
* 06:58AM
  - Executed requested cleanup pass and freeze finalization for Segment 1A and Segment 1B.
  - `1A` updates:
    - reaffirmed frozen-certified authority posture (`FROZEN_CERTIFIED_B`) in:
      - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md`
      - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md`
    - converted conditional reopen DoD items to explicit `not entered / not applicable` dispositions for this cycle.
  - `1B` updates:
    - converted remaining open checklist items to explicit disposition outcomes (`not entered`, `fail-closed`, or `deferred-by-freeze`) in:
      - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
    - pinned freeze status as `FROZEN_BEST_EFFORT_BELOW_B` and recorded active authority artifact.
    - appended decision-trail entry in:
      - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
  - Transition posture locked:
    - `1A` frozen-certified authority,
    - `1B` frozen-best-effort-below-certification authority,
    - proceed to planning/execution on Segment 2A.
* 07:08AM
  - Started Segment 2A remediation planning pass (doc-authority read completed before drafting).
  - Created new 2A build-plan doc:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.build_plan.md`
  - Plan posture pinned:
    - objective remains `B/B+`,
    - active-cycle constraint: `1A` and `1B` remain frozen (no upstream reopen in this pass),
    - causal lane prioritizes 2A governance/scoring hardening and rejects synthetic post-assignment redistribution as primary fix.
  - Defined phased plan + DoDs:
    - `P0` baseline/harness lock,
    - `P1` fallback/override governance hardening,
    - `P2` cohort-aware realism scoring/gates,
    - `P3` bounded targeted correction lane,
    - `P4` seed-pack certification or constrained freeze.
  - Appended matching decision trail entry to:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
* 02:35AM
  - Opened pre-change lock to pin unresolved M6.A handles in registry.
  - Target handles:
    - `IG_BASE_URL`, `TD_SR`, `TD_WSP`, `ROLE_SR_TASK`, `ROLE_WSP_TASK`.
  - Planned pin posture:
    - `IG_BASE_URL = http://fraud-platform-dev-min-ig:8080`
    - `TD_SR = fraud-platform-dev-min-sr`
    - `TD_WSP = fraud-platform-dev-min-wsp`
    - `ROLE_SR_TASK = fraud-platform-dev-min-rtdl-core`
    - `ROLE_WSP_TASK = fraud-platform-dev-min-rtdl-core`
* 03:13AM
  - Pinned missing M6 handles in registry:
    - `IG_BASE_URL`, `TD_SR`, `TD_WSP`, `ROLE_SR_TASK`, `ROLE_WSP_TASK`.
  - Reran `M6.A` and published new snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T031058Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T031058Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - Result: handle-unresolved blocker cleared (`M6A-B2` closed); current blocker is materialization only (`M6A-B4`) for:
    - `TD_SR`, `TD_WSP`.
* 03:28AM
  - Materialized `TD_SR` and `TD_WSP` in Terraform demo stack via targeted apply.
  - New ECS task families:
    - `fraud-platform-dev-min-sr`
    - `fraud-platform-dev-min-wsp`
  - Reran `M6.A` and closed PASS:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T032545Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T032545Z/m6_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - Result:
    - `resolved_handle_count=35/35`
    - `unresolved_handle_count=0`
    - `overall_pass=true`
  - Updated M6 planning docs to mark `M6.A` complete and move next action to `M6.B`.
* 03:33AM
  - Executed `M6.B` IG readiness/auth-boundary checks.
  - Published snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T033201Z/m6_b_ig_readiness_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T033201Z/m6_b_ig_readiness_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed (`overall_pass=false`) with blocker `M6B-B2`.
  - Key findings:
    - IG service stable but task definition is placeholder daemon loop,
    - app SG has zero ingress rules,
    - IG API key in SSM is placeholder,
    - health and ingest probes timed out.
  - Updated M6 plans: M6.B remains open; next action is close `M6B-B2` then rerun M6.B.

## 03:41AM
- M6.B closure lane opened per USER direction (Proceed with those and then rerun m6.B).
- Captured pre-implementation decision entry in platform.impl_actual.md.
- Planned closure actions: IG real runtime command + port mapping, SG ingress 8080, non-placeholder IG API key in SSM, rerun M6.B with durable evidence.

## 04:07AM
- Closed M6.B after materializing IG runtime/auth/network boundary.
- Applied demo Terraform updates:
  - IG non-placeholder runtime command + port mapping,
  - app SG ingress 	cp/8080,
  - ig_service lane object-store policy attach,
  - non-placeholder SSM_IG_API_KEY_PATH value.
- Authoritative PASS evidence:
  - local: uns/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T040527Z/m6_b_ig_readiness_snapshot.json
  - durable: s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T040527Z/m6_b_ig_readiness_snapshot.json
  - result: overall_pass=true, blocker set empty.
- Probe contract in PASS run:
  - health (auth) 200,
  - unauth ingest 401,
  - auth ingest 200.

## 06:38AM
- Started M6.C planning only (no execution).
- Identified pre-execution drift from current IG runtime: vent_bus_kind=file + local uns store root (M6.B shim mode).
- Marked intent to pin this as an explicit M6.C blocker because P4/M6.C authority requires managed Kafka + durable S3 smoke evidence.

## 06:39AM
- Patched M6 planning docs for execution-grade M6.C.
- Added explicit pre-execution blocker M6C-B4 (IG runtime still in temporary ile-bus/local-store shim mode from M6.B closure).
- Main plan next action now requires closing M6C-B4 before M6.C execution.

## 07:18AM
- Executed `M6.C` fail-closed preflight and published authoritative blocker snapshot.
- Artifacts:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T071807Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T071807Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
- Result:
  - `overall_pass=false`
  - blocker `M6C-B4` confirmed open (IG still using local-parity file-bus/local-runs shim posture).
- No Kafka smoke / offset verification / `ingest/ig_ready.json` claim was made while blocker was open.

## 08:31AM
- Executed IG runtime rematerialization to close `M6C-B4`:
  - note: Terraform CLI plan/apply repeatedly timed out in this shell during this lane, so runtime rematerialization was applied via controlled live operations and mirrored in IaC file updates for later state convergence.
  - created managed stream `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig-bus-v0`,
  - attached IG publish policy to role `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig-service`,
  - rolled IG task definition from `:5` -> `:6` -> `:7` with:
    - managed object-store root (`s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs`),
    - `event_bus_kind=kinesis`, stream binding `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig-bus-v0`,
    - startup contract shim for missing layer-1 schema dependency.
- Recorded intermediate fail-closed M6.C retries:
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T082355Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T082520Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T083016Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
- Authoritative closure rerun:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T083126Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T083126Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - run-scoped readiness artifact:
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/ig_ready.json`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, blocker set empty.

## 08:33AM
- Security note:
  - local operator credential files were inspected during blocker diagnosis,
  - sensitive values must not be copied into docs/notes,
  - rotate exposed AWS access keys before continuing later phases.
## 08:34AM
- Produced engine network graph deliverables from Data Engine implementation-map sources (segment_*.impl_map.yaml) with cross-segment gate flow inference and segment/layer/state labeling.
- Added generator script:
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/generate_engine_state_network.py
- Generated outputs:
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.dot
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.mmd
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.txt
- Scope posture:
  - engine scanned as documentation/graphing surface only,
  - no engine runtime logic changed.
## 08:35AM
- Refactored engine graph tooling location per repo posture:
  - moved generator from docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/ to scripts/engine_state_network/generate_engine_state_network.py.
- Hardened repo-root discovery in generator (no fixed parent-depth assumption).
- Re-ran generator from scripts/ location and confirmed assets still emit to:
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.dot
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.mmd
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.txt
## 08:42AM
- Upgraded engine state-network deliverables for human-readable external sharing (LinkedIn posture).
- Generator enhancement (scripts/engine_state_network/generate_engine_state_network.py):
  - aligned layer labels to README concept-map language (Layer 1/2/3 semantic naming),
  - pulled state titles from state-expanded spec docs (state.*.expanded.md) instead of raw SC/RNG-only labels,
  - added curated title overrides for ambiguous states (1A.S3, 1A.S4, 1B.S0),
  - translated gate IDs into readable flow labels (PASS bundle, Gate-in receipt, Validation receipt),
  - reduced gate clutter by collapsing repetitive S0 gate-in fanout edges to a single readable dependency per segment,
  - hardened markdown heading parsing and text normalization for mixed doc encodings.
- Regenerated artifacts (unchanged locations):
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.dot
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.mmd
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network.txt
## 08:46AM
- Added a carousel-safe Data Engine story-map variant (segment-level condensation) for external sharing.
- Generator updates in scripts/engine_state_network/generate_engine_state_network.py:
  - added segment-level renderers (DOT, Mermaid, ASCII) using concise narrative labels,
  - included primary story arc (1A -> 1B -> 2A -> 2B -> 3A -> 3B -> 5A -> 5B -> 6A -> 6B),
  - overlaid pass/gate dependencies as lighter branch edges,
  - removed governance edges that duplicate the primary story path to reduce visual clutter.
- New artifacts generated:
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.dot
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.mmd
  - docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.txt
## 12:36PM
- Reverted carousel variant per user direction.
- Removed carousel-only generation logic from `scripts/engine_state_network/generate_engine_state_network.py`.
- Deleted carousel artifacts:
  - `docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.dot`
  - `docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.mmd`
  - `docs/design/data-engine/engine_state_network/engine_state_network_carousel.txt`
- Regenerated and confirmed only the primary detailed outputs remain.
## 12:43PM
- Completed Terraform convergence for IG rematerialization lane in `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo`.
- Imported managed stream resource into Terraform state:
  - `module.demo.aws_kinesis_stream.ig_event_bus` -> `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig-bus-v0`.
- Applied demo stack with pinned runtime vars (`required_platform_run_id`, current daemon image digest, current IG API key from SSM).
- Post-apply results:
  - IG task definition now `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig:8`,
  - managed inline policy materialized (`fraud-platform-dev-min-ig_service-kinesis-publish`),
  - final `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` returned `0` (no drift).
- Re-ran M6.C after convergence:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T124328Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T124328Z/m6_c_ingest_ready_snapshot.json`
  - refreshed run-scoped readiness artifact:
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/ig_ready.json`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers empty.
## 01:38PM
- Executed M6.D planning expansion only (no runtime mutation).
- Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M6.build_plan.md` M6.D section to execution-grade:
  - pinned entry prerequisites from latest M6.C evidence,
  - explicit lane sequence (`M6.D.1` preflight through `M6.D.7` fail-closed verdict),
  - expanded blocker taxonomy (`M6D-B1..M6D-B5`),
  - pinned snapshot contract fields for `m6_d_sr_ready_snapshot.json`.
- Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` M6 status narrative to reflect M6.D planning readiness.
- Result:
  - M6.D planning closure complete,
  - next action remains M6.D execution.
## 12:50PM
- Governance update requested and applied: performance-first posture is now binding in agent routers.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` (root):
  - added `2.6) Performance-First Law (binding, platformwide)` with explicit rules against wait-it-out execution,
  - required algorithm/data-structure optimization before resource scaling,
  - required runtime budgets + measured evidence + fail-closed behavior on regressions/stalls,
  - required logging-volume budgeting and preservation of determinism/statistical quality.
- Updated `packages/engine/AGENTS.md`:
  - strengthened logging section with explicit performance budget language,
  - added `Remediation sequencing law (engine, binding)` requiring performance triage before statistical remediation,
  - required minute-scale state budgets, single-process efficient baseline first, and fail-closed stall handling.
## 12:57PM
- Hardened performance governance wording in both routers per user direction to enforce stronger severity.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` performance law with two additional binding clauses:
  - mandatory pre-implementation performance design (complexity/data-structure/search-join/IO + rejected alternatives),
  - hard performance gate that blocks implementation/remediation progression without measured runtime improvement vs baseline and movement toward minute-scale budgets.
- Updated `packages/engine/AGENTS.md` remediation sequencing law with matching engine-specific clauses:
  - mandatory pre-remediation performance design,
  - hard phase-progression performance gate tied to measured elapsed evidence.
## 01:14PM
- Updated Segment 1B build plan with a dedicated optimization program before further realism tuning.
- Added `Performance Optimization Set (POPT.0 -> POPT.4)` to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`.
- New optimization posture is code-first and bottleneck-ordered:
  - primary: `S4`, secondary: `S5`, closure: `S9`.
- Added explicit runtime budgets and fail-closed gates:
  - `S4 <= 12m` (stretch `<=15m`),
  - `S5 <= 6m` (stretch `<=8m`),
  - `S9 <= 2m30s` (stretch `<=3m30s`),
  - phase progression blocked without measured runtime improvement and deterministic/contract stability.
- Appended decision trail in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md` (`Entry: 2026-02-15 13:13`).
## 01:35PM
- Executed Segment 1B `POPT.0` and locked baseline runtime/hotspot contract.
- Added reusable scorer tool:
  - `tools/score_segment1b_popt0_baseline.py`
- Generated baseline artifacts for authority run `9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306`:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_popt0_baseline_9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306.json`
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_popt0_hotspot_map_9ebdd751ab7b4f9da246cc840ddff306.md`
- Locked bottleneck ranking by measured segment share:
  - `S4: 53.97%`,
  - `S5: 20.08%`,
  - `S9: 6.04%`.
- Updated `segment_1B.build_plan.md` to mark `POPT.0` DoD complete and added closure record with artifact paths and gate decision (`GO` to `POPT.1`).
- Appended implementation decision trail in `segment_1B.impl_actual.md` (`Entry: 2026-02-15 13:32` + `Entry: 2026-02-15 13:35`).
## 01:40PM
- Expanded Segment 1B `POPT.1` plan into execution-grade sub-phases in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`.
- `POPT.1` now contains:
  - baseline metrics + explicit hotspot hypotheses,
  - `POPT.1.1` to `POPT.1.6` phased lanes,
  - concrete DoDs per lane,
  - fail-closed closure classification (`GREEN/AMBER/RED`) that blocks move to `POPT.2` unless S4 runtime gate is met.
- Appended planning rationale/decision trail in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md` (`Entry: 2026-02-15 13:40`).
* 01:46PM
  - Opened `POPT.1` execution lock for Segment 1B (`S4` optimization lane).
  - Pinned implementation sequence before code edits:
    - `POPT.1.1` substage timing instrumentation in S4 run report,
    - `POPT.1.2` country-asset locality and cache-churn reduction,
    - `POPT.1.3` rank-prefix kernel rewrite to `(country,n_sites)` full-rank caching,
    - `POPT.1.4` logging cadence budget,
    - `POPT.1.5` determinism + downstream smoke evidence,
    - `POPT.1.6` runtime classification vs POPT.0 authority.
  - Recorded pre-change decision rationale in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.
## 01:49PM
- Built a new implementation-true local parity platform graph asset set (Spine Green v0) from current pack/profile wiring + local parity design addenda.
- Added generator code under `scripts/platform_graphs/build_local_parity_spine_graph_assets.py` (code lives in scripts; docs keep only rendered assets).
- Generated and wrote three deliverables under `docs/design/platform/local-parity/graph/`:
  - `local_parity_spine_green_v0.graphviz.dot`
  - `local_parity_spine_green_v0.mermaid.mmd`
  - `local_parity_spine_green_v0.ascii.txt`
- Graph scope/labels include:
  - spine phase chain `P0`->`P11`,
  - in-scope packs (`control_ingress`, `rtdl_core`, `rtdl_decision_lane`, `case_labels`, `obs_gov`),
  - topic lanes (`traffic`, `context`, `rtdl`, `case`, `audit`),
  - ownership/evidence sinks (IG receipts/quarantine/index, archive evidence, DLA records, run report/conformance/governance append),
  - active run pin and substrate wiring (MinIO, Kinesis, Postgres DSN mesh).
- Updated `docs/design/platform/local-parity/README.md` to index the new graph assets and the generator script path.
- Verification note: Graphviz CLI (`dot`) is not installed in this environment, so SVG render validation could not be executed locally.
* 01:50PM
  - Implemented `POPT.1` code lanes in `S4` runner (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/runner.py`).
  - Added `POPT.1.1` substage timing surfaces in `s4_run_report`:
    - `country_asset_load`, `rank_prefix`, `allocation_kernel`, `batch_write`.
  - Applied `POPT.1.2` locality changes:
    - one-pass preload of `s3_requirements` + per-country frequency map,
    - frequency-based cache pinning budget (`ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_PIN_COUNTRIES_MAX`),
    - reduced tile-weight country-column scans for country-partitioned files.
  - Applied `POPT.1.3` rank-kernel rewrite:
    - cache key now `(country,n_sites)` full-rank vectors with prefix slicing.
  - Applied `POPT.1.4` logging cadence controls:
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
    - `ENGINE_1B_S4_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
  - Immediate compile guard passed:
    - `python -m py_compile packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/runner.py`.

## 02:48PM
- Executed M6.D (`P5 READY_PUBLISHED`) to closure with fail-closed reruns and authoritative PASS evidence.
- Authoritative closure artifacts:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260215T144233Z/m6_d_sr_ready_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260215T144233Z/m6_d_sr_ready_snapshot.json`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers empty.
- SR READY proof:
  - run id: `78d859d39f4232fc510463fb868bc6e1`
  - status artifact: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/sr/run_status/78d859d39f4232fc510463fb868bc6e1.json` (`READY`)
  - ready signal: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/sr/ready_signal/78d859d39f4232fc510463fb868bc6e1.json`
  - control-bus sequence: `49671822697342044645261017794300307957859908788827455490` on `fraud-platform-dev-min-ig-bus-v0`.
- Key fail-closed blockers encountered and resolved in-sequence:
  - `M6D-B2`: SR launch/runtime failures (command path + evidence root scope),
  - `M6D-B3`: SR pass semantics missing due oracle-root/schema-reference mismatch,
  - `M6D-B4`: READY missing while upstream pass semantics unresolved.
- Execution notes captured explicitly:
  - closure run requested only `s3_event_stream_with_fraud_6B` because it is the only currently materialized stream-view output under the active oracle stream-view root,
  - task-scoped shims used for this closure run:
    - interface-pack layer-1 schema reference stub,
    - lease keepalive loop for long evidence-reuse windows.
