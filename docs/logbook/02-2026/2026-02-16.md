* 12:23AM
  - Began `POPT.4` integrated fast-lane recertification for Segment `1B`.
  - Staged a fresh candidate lane run-id from baseline authority (`runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`) using junctions:
    - candidate run-id: `a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e`
    - staging receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/popt4_stage_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
    - used `--skip-s3-requirements` so `S3` is regenerated under the active governed requirements policy (denylist) to avoid downstream coverage mismatch.
* 12:24AM
  - Executed the progressive chain sequentially (no skipping upstream dependencies):
    - `S3 -> S4 -> S5 -> S6 -> S7 -> S8 -> S9`.
  - Verified the prior `S7` parity blocker is closed under active requirements policy (`2026-02-14.mc-bm-exclusion.v1`):
    - `S7` reported `s5=29340 s6=29340 outlet_catalogue_effective=29340`.
  - `S9` validation bundle decision: `PASS` (`--validate-only` fast lane).
* 12:29AM
  - Produced integrated scorer report for the candidate lane:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
  - Observed posture:
    - `no_regression=true`
    - `B/B+` grading still fails (realism tuning work remains separate from `POPT.*` runtime closure).
* 12:31AM
  - Pruned superseded failed run-id folder to protect local disk:
    - removed: `d7cdd70de7bc4328b7bef14e7a9e5308`
    - tool: `tools/prune_run_folders_keep_set.py` (dry-run then `--yes`).
* 12:36AM
  - Recorded post-`POPT.*` performance plan-of-record for Segment `1B`:
    - `S3->S9` integrated iteration is now minute-scale; dominant remaining wall-time chunk is `S6`.
    - next perf target (optional): `S6` only (jitter/geometry acceleration) under Fast-Compute-Safe posture.
  - Appended decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
* 5:26AM
  - Opened bounded `1B` realism sweep (`max 2 candidates`) after `POPT.4` closure.
  - Hardened staging helper for `S2` reruns:
    - updated `tools/stage_segment1b_candidate_lane.py` with `--skip-tile-weights`.
  - Candidate `R1` staged and executed:
    - run-id: `d0d35786b6c241738c392a7d0393d0fe`
    - chain: `S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5 -> S6 -> S7 -> S8 -> S9`
    - score artifact: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_d0d35786b6c241738c392a7d0393d0fe.json`
* 5:36AM
  - Candidate `R2` staged and executed:
    - run-id: `f5df0b9e80cf4ce3b46f4609a2597c43`
    - chain: `S5 -> S6 -> S7 -> S8 -> S9` (from `R1` staged `S4` alloc-plan lane)
    - score artifact: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_f5df0b9e80cf4ce3b46f4609a2597c43.json`
  - Sweep result:
    - both candidates remained `RED_REOPEN_REQUIRED`,
    - failing B metrics unchanged (country concentration, eligible-country nonzero share, southern-share).
  - Restored policies to pre-sweep authority state:
    - `config/layer1/1B/policy/policy.s2.tile_weights.yaml`
    - `config/layer1/1B/policy/policy.s6.jitter.yaml`
  - Logged structural conclusion in implementation docs:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
* 5:58AM
  - Applied explicit freeze carry-forward for Segment `1B` into 2A planning:
    - `1B` remains `FROZEN_BEST_EFFORT_BELOW_B`.
    - locked integrated authority for planning context:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
    - no-regression anchor run-id:
      - `979129e39a89446b942df9a463f09508`
  - Expanded Segment `2A` build plan with a dedicated performance program mirroring 1B:
    - `POPT.0` baseline/hotspot lock
    - `POPT.1` primary hotspot rewrite
    - `POPT.2` secondary hotspot rewrite
    - `POPT.3` validation-path acceleration
    - `POPT.4` integrated fast-lane recertification
  - Updated decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
## Dev-Substrate: M6.G (P7 INGEST_COMMITTED) - Executed, FAIL (Run: platform_20260213T214223Z)

Executed `M6.G` (P7 ingest commit verification) using managed compute (one-shot ECS task) and wrote the run-scoped P7 evidence surfaces. Verdict is **FAIL** (fail-closed) with concrete blockers and root-cause identified.

**Authoritative evidence (S3):**
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/receipt_summary.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/quarantine_summary.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/kafka_offsets_snapshot.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/m6_g_ingest_commit_snapshot.json`

**Snapshot verdict:**
- `overall_pass=false`
- blockers:
  - `M6G-B7:KAFKA_OFFSETS_ZERO` (Confluent topics exist + readable, but offsets stayed at 0)
  - `M6G-B6:RECEIPT_ENVIRONMENT_MISMATCH` (IG receipts show `environment=local_parity`, `policy_rev=local-parity-v0`)
  - `M6G-B8:QUARANTINE_NONZERO` (non-zero quarantine is not green for Spine Green v0)

**Observed counts (from receipt summary):**
- receipts: `ADMIT=5`, `QUARANTINE=802` (total `807`)
- reason codes: `INTERNAL_ERROR=800`, `ENVELOPE_INVALID=2`
- environment: `local_parity` (all receipts)

**Root cause (from IG ECS logs):**
- IG schema enforcement is failing with an unresolvable reference:
  - `Unresolvable: schemas.layer3.yaml#/$defs/hex64`
  - This is referenced transitively from `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/schemas.6B.yaml`.

**Implications (dev_min authority):**
- P7 requires Kafka offsets advancement for admitted traffic/context topics, but IG is currently not publishing to Kafka and is quarantining most events due to schema-resolution failure.
- Until this is fixed, downstream planes must not consume “officially” (No PASS -> No read).

**Remediation plan (next actions):**
- Include the missing engine schema file(s) in the runtime image (`schemas.layer3.yaml` for segment 6B) so IG payload validation can succeed.
- Remove the IG `local_parity` profile shim and run IG under the `dev_min` profile so provenance pins are correct.
- Add Kafka EventBus publisher support and wire IG publish lane to Confluent, so offsets advance and P7 can PASS.

* 6:42AM
  - Closed IG health drift that was blocking `M6.G`:
    - Kafka health probe now uses topic partition metadata (not only `bootstrap_connected()`).
    - Probe stream derivation now ignores non-topic `event_bus_path` values and scopes Kafka probes to Spine Green ingress-required traffic/context topics.
  - Rebuilt/published image via `dev_min_m1_packaging.yml` and rematerialized ECS task definitions/services through `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo`.
  - Verified IG preflight surface:
    - `/v1/ops/health` returns `{"state":"GREEN","reasons":[]}`.

## Dev-Substrate: M6.G (P7 INGEST_COMMITTED) - Executed, PASS (Run: platform_20260213T214223Z)

Executed `M6.G` closure rerun after IG health drift remediation and produced authoritative PASS evidence.

**Authoritative evidence:**

**Snapshot verdict:**
- `overall_pass=true`
- blockers: none

**Closure facts:**
- preflight:
  - IG health `GREEN`
  - receipts pinned to `environment=dev_min`, `policy_rev=dev-min-v0`
  - ADMIT `offset_kind=kafka_offset`
- receipts:
  - `ADMIT=800`, `DUPLICATE=800`, `QUARANTINE=0`
- ambiguity:
  - `publish_ambiguous_count=0`
  - `publish_in_flight_count=0`
- Kafka proof:
  - all 4 required topics have run-window offsets and readable sample messages with `platform_run_id` match.

* 5:39PM
  - Planned and materialized CI teardown lane for Confluent stack to remove local secret dependency.
  - Added workflow: .github/workflows/dev_min_confluent_destroy.yml (OIDC AWS auth + GitHub Secrets mapping for Confluent Cloud management keys).
  - Pinned planning ownership split:
    - M2.I = teardown capability build/hardening.
    - M9/P12 = canonical teardown execution using the M2.I workflow lane.

* 6:22PM
  - Released narrow ops workflow to main via PR #50: .github/workflows/dev_min_confluent_destroy.yml.
  - Synced branches for forward-merge continuity:
    - main -> dev (22d66ae), then dev -> migrate-dev (115cc93a).
  - Executed managed Confluent destroy workflow:
    - first run failed closed on IAM (s3:ListBucketVersions missing on evidence bucket),
    - patched role GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction inline policy GitHubActionsTerraformConfluentStateDevMin,
    - reran workflow and passed: https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22073499196.
  - PASS proof: overall_pass=true, post_destroy_state_resource_count=0, durable snapshot under vidence/dev_min/substrate/m2i_confluent_destroy_20260216T181749Z/.
