* 12:23AM
  - Began `POPT.4` integrated fast-lane recertification for Segment `1B`.
  - Staged a fresh candidate lane run-id from baseline authority (`runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`) using junctions:
    - candidate run-id: `a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e`
    - staging receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/popt4_stage_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
    - used `--skip-s3-requirements` so `S3` is regenerated under the active governed requirements policy (denylist) to avoid downstream coverage mismatch.
* 12:24AM
  - Executed the progressive chain sequentially (no skipping upstream dependencies):
    - `S3 -> S4 -> S5 -> S6 -> S7 -> S8 -> S9`.
  - Verified the prior `S7` parity blocker is closed under active requirements policy (`2026-02-14.mc-bm-exclusion.v1`):
    - `S7` reported `s5=29340 s6=29340 outlet_catalogue_effective=29340`.
  - `S9` validation bundle decision: `PASS` (`--validate-only` fast lane).
* 12:29AM
  - Produced integrated scorer report for the candidate lane:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
  - Observed posture:
    - `no_regression=true`
    - `B/B+` grading still fails (realism tuning work remains separate from `POPT.*` runtime closure).
* 12:31AM
  - Pruned superseded failed run-id folder to protect local disk:
    - removed: `d7cdd70de7bc4328b7bef14e7a9e5308`
    - tool: `tools/prune_run_folders_keep_set.py` (dry-run then `--yes`).
