* 12:23AM
  - Began `POPT.4` integrated fast-lane recertification for Segment `1B`.
  - Staged a fresh candidate lane run-id from baseline authority (`runs/local_full_run-5/c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`) using junctions:
    - candidate run-id: `a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e`
    - staging receipt: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/popt4_stage_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
    - used `--skip-s3-requirements` so `S3` is regenerated under the active governed requirements policy (denylist) to avoid downstream coverage mismatch.
* 12:24AM
  - Executed the progressive chain sequentially (no skipping upstream dependencies):
    - `S3 -> S4 -> S5 -> S6 -> S7 -> S8 -> S9`.
  - Verified the prior `S7` parity blocker is closed under active requirements policy (`2026-02-14.mc-bm-exclusion.v1`):
    - `S7` reported `s5=29340 s6=29340 outlet_catalogue_effective=29340`.
  - `S9` validation bundle decision: `PASS` (`--validate-only` fast lane).
* 12:29AM
  - Produced integrated scorer report for the candidate lane:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_a0ae54639efc4955bc41a2e266224e6e.json`
  - Observed posture:
    - `no_regression=true`
    - `B/B+` grading still fails (realism tuning work remains separate from `POPT.*` runtime closure).
* 12:31AM
  - Pruned superseded failed run-id folder to protect local disk:
    - removed: `d7cdd70de7bc4328b7bef14e7a9e5308`
    - tool: `tools/prune_run_folders_keep_set.py` (dry-run then `--yes`).
* 12:36AM
  - Recorded post-`POPT.*` performance plan-of-record for Segment `1B`:
    - `S3->S9` integrated iteration is now minute-scale; dominant remaining wall-time chunk is `S6`.
    - next perf target (optional): `S6` only (jitter/geometry acceleration) under Fast-Compute-Safe posture.
  - Appended decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`
## Dev-Substrate: M6.G (P7 INGEST_COMMITTED) - Executed, FAIL (Run: platform_20260213T214223Z)

Executed `M6.G` (P7 ingest commit verification) using managed compute (one-shot ECS task) and wrote the run-scoped P7 evidence surfaces. Verdict is **FAIL** (fail-closed) with concrete blockers and root-cause identified.

**Authoritative evidence (S3):**
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/receipt_summary.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/quarantine_summary.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/kafka_offsets_snapshot.json`
- `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/ingest/m6_g_ingest_commit_snapshot.json`

**Snapshot verdict:**
- `overall_pass=false`
- blockers:
  - `M6G-B7:KAFKA_OFFSETS_ZERO` (Confluent topics exist + readable, but offsets stayed at 0)
  - `M6G-B6:RECEIPT_ENVIRONMENT_MISMATCH` (IG receipts show `environment=local_parity`, `policy_rev=local-parity-v0`)
  - `M6G-B8:QUARANTINE_NONZERO` (non-zero quarantine is not green for Spine Green v0)

**Observed counts (from receipt summary):**
- receipts: `ADMIT=5`, `QUARANTINE=802` (total `807`)
- reason codes: `INTERNAL_ERROR=800`, `ENVELOPE_INVALID=2`
- environment: `local_parity` (all receipts)

**Root cause (from IG ECS logs):**
- IG schema enforcement is failing with an unresolvable reference:
  - `Unresolvable: schemas.layer3.yaml#/$defs/hex64`
  - This is referenced transitively from `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/schemas.6B.yaml`.

**Implications (dev_min authority):**
- P7 requires Kafka offsets advancement for admitted traffic/context topics, but IG is currently not publishing to Kafka and is quarantining most events due to schema-resolution failure.
- Until this is fixed, downstream planes must not consume “officially” (No PASS -> No read).

**Remediation plan (next actions):**
- Include the missing engine schema file(s) in the runtime image (`schemas.layer3.yaml` for segment 6B) so IG payload validation can succeed.
- Remove the IG `local_parity` profile shim and run IG under the `dev_min` profile so provenance pins are correct.
- Add Kafka EventBus publisher support and wire IG publish lane to Confluent, so offsets advance and P7 can PASS.
