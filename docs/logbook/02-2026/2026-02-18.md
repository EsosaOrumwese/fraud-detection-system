  - Pre-change lock recorded in:

  - Planned patch scope:
    - expand M7 migration/execution section in `platform.build_plan.md`,
    - create execution-grade deep plan file `platform.M7.build_plan.md`,
    - keep this step planning-only (no runtime/infra execution).

  - Applied M7 planning expansion patch.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
      - M7 set to `ACTIVE`
      - M7 section expanded to execution-grade structure (`M7.A..M7.J`)
      - immediate next action moved to `M7.A` handle closure
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
      - added pre-change and post-change M7 planning entries
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.build_plan.md`
      - full deep plan for `P8..P10` with anti-cram lane coverage, blockers, DoD, and evidence contract.
  - Execution posture for this step:
    - planning-only; no runtime/infra actions.
