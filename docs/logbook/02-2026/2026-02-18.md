    - M7 now has explicit per-plane planning rails (`P8`, `P9`, `P10`) to reduce rush risk and prevent premature phase closure.
  - Execution posture:
    - planning-only; no runtime/infra actions.

* 1:26PM
  - Entered Segment `2B` `POPT.1` execution lane (primary hotspot optimization).
  - Re-read binding authority for `2B.S5` before code edits:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2B/state.2B.s5.expanded.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml`

    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/artefact_registry_2B.yaml`
  - Appended pre-change execution plan in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked optimization scope for this step:
    - preserve routing/RNG semantics and contract behavior,
    - optimize `S5` hot loop and validation overhead only,
    - no realism-shape tuning or policy/config changes in `POPT.1`.

* 1:35PM
  - Implemented `2B.S5` primary hotspot optimization (`POPT.1`):
    - file changed:
      - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s5_router/runner.py`
    - key changes:
      - added `ENGINE_2B_S5_INPUT_VALIDATION_MODE={strict,sample}` with
        fix-lane default `sample`,
      - added bounded sample control
        `ENGINE_2B_S5_INPUT_VALIDATION_SAMPLE_ROWS`,
      - replaced per-row validation list allocations with first-error checks,
      - removed redundant timezone index pass and tightened alias-path lookups.
  - Performance evidence captured:
    - profile before:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s5_popt1_profile_before.prof`
      - runtime `97.757s`, dominated by `validate_dataframe` (`84.305s`).
    - profile after:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s5_popt1_profile_after.prof`
      - runtime `13.383s`, `validate_dataframe` down to `1.903s`.
    - candidate state run:
      - run root: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B`
      - run id: `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
      - observed `S5` elapsed: `5.92s` (vs POPT.0 baseline `30.477s`).
  - Structural non-regression:
    - `s5_run_report.json` emitted with `V-01..V-16` all `PASS`.
  - Determinism replay note:
    - second same-run replay still triggers legacy `2B-S5-080` write-once
      conflict due runtime-varying `ts_utc` fields in event payload bytes.
  - Updated planning/decision records:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`

* 1:44PM
  - Closed `2B.S5` replay-idempotence gap (`POPT.1` completion blocker).
  - Root cause fixed:
    - S5 persisted RNG event/trace rows used runtime-varying `ts_utc`, causing
      non-identical bytes and `2B-S5-080` on second same-run replay.
  - Code update:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s5_router/runner.py`
    - added deterministic timestamp sequencing anchored to S0 `created_utc` for
      persisted S5 RNG event + trace rows.
  - Replay witness executed (same seed + same inputs):
    - runs root:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt1_replay_20260218_134345`
    - run id:
      - `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
    - first run: pass with validators `V-01..V-16 = PASS`
    - second run (no cleanup): pass with idempotent byte-skip evidence:
      - `rng_event_alias_pick_group already exists and is identical`
      - `rng_event_alias_pick_site already exists and is identical`
      - `rng_trace_log already exists and is identical`
  - Updated closure records:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`

* 1:47PM
  - Entered Segment `2B` `POPT.2` execution lane (secondary hotspot `S4`).
  - Reviewed/locked authority before implementation:
    - `state.2B.s4.expanded.md`
    - `schemas.2B.yaml`
    - `dataset_dictionary.layer1.2B.yaml`
    - `artefact_registry_2B.yaml`

  - Appended pre-change execution plan in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
  - Scope lock:
    - performance-only optimization of `S4`,
    - preserve normalization semantics, writer order, and idempotent publish law,
    - no realism-shape policy/config tuning in this phase.

* 1:52PM
  - Executed and closed Segment `2B` `POPT.2` (`S4` secondary hotspot).
  - Code updates:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s4_group_weights/runner.py`
    - added `ENGINE_2B_S4_OUTPUT_VALIDATION_MODE={strict,sample}` and

    - profile before:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s4_popt2_profile_before.prof`
      - `68.774s`, dominated by `_write_batch -> validate_dataframe`.
    - profile after:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s4_popt2_profile_after.prof`
      - `7.622s`, with major validation-path reduction.
    - timed run evidence (run root:
      `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt2_20260218_134742`):
      - pre-change strict witness: `25.81s`,
      - post-change sample lane: `2.92s`,
      - strict compatibility check: `26.05s`.
  - Non-regression evidence:

    - counters/invariants remained intact (`rows_expected=rows_written=278100`,
      `join_misses=0`, `pk_duplicates=0`).
    - report snapshots:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s4_popt2_run_report_strict.json`
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/s4_popt2_run_report_sample.json`

    - remediation: re-apply with newer immutable image digest:
      - `230372904534.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/fraud-platform-dev-min@sha256:ec6818d66ce3a7be38c22f4a1ddd6f88c3b7699356681deb07df5c3a32fa4531`.
  - Final runtime posture:

    - RDS `fraud-platform-dev-min-db` status `available`.

* 1:59PM
  - Entered Segment `2B` `POPT.3` execution lane (I/O + logging budget).
  - Captured pre-change `S3` witness baseline (same authority run-id):
    - command: `make segment2b-s3`
    - runs root: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B`
    - run id: `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
    - measured wall clock: `21.861s`
    - state timer: `S3 completed (elapsed=20.73s)`
  - Pinned implementation scope before code edits:
    - add bounded output-validation lane controls (`strict/sample`) for S3,
    - cap progress-log cadence with explicit env knob,
    - keep required run-report artifact while reducing INFO log payload size,
    - preserve deterministic/statistical semantics and contract posture.
  - Appended full pre-change decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`

* 2:03PM
  - Executed Segment `2B` `POPT.3` on `S3` (I/O + logging budget lane).
  - Code updated:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s3_day_effects/runner.py`
    - added output-validation mode controls (`strict/sample` + sample rows),
    - added progress cadence env knob,
    - replaced INFO full run-report JSON logging with summary (full JSON now opt-in).
  - Runtime evidence:
    - pre-change baseline (`make segment2b-s3`): `21.861s` wall clock,
    - post-change sample lane: `3.233s` wall clock,
    - strict fallback witness: `21.287s` wall clock.
  - Logging evidence:
    - `S3 run-report` INFO line length reduced from `12613` chars to ~`201` chars
      while run-report file artifact remains emitted.
  - Non-regression evidence:
    - strict/sample snapshots saved under
      `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/`:
      - `s3_popt3_run_report_strict.json`
      - `s3_popt3_run_report_sample.json`
    - structural counters unchanged (`rows_expected=rows_written=278100`,
      `join_misses=0`, `pk_duplicates=0`) and validators fail/warn = `0/0`.

* 2:16PM
  - Executed platform `M7.A` authority/handle closure on rematerialized dev substrate.
  - Entry anchors validated:
    - local handoff: `runs/dev_substrate/m6/20260216T214025Z/m7_handoff_pack.json`
    - durable handoff: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m6_20260216T214025Z/m7_handoff_pack.json`
    - invariants: `m6_verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M7`, `blockers=[]`, run id preserved.
  - M7.A snapshot published:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m7/20260218T141420Z/m7_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - result: `overall_pass=true`, `resolved_handle_count=40`, `unresolved_handle_count=0`.
  - Probe basis:
    - ECS/role probes from live runtime (`aws ecs describe-services`, `aws iam get-role`),
    - topic/materialization probe from latest M2.F snapshot:
      - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/substrate/m2_20260218T133848Z/topic_readiness_snapshot.json`,
    - DB/SSM path checks (`aws rds describe-db-instances`, `aws ssm get-parameter`).
  - Forward debt explicitly recorded (not M7.A blocker, but blocks P10 entry):
    - `M7G-B1` open because subject-key handles are still placeholders:
      - `CASE_SUBJECT_KEY_FIELDS=<PIN_AT_P10_PHASE_ENTRY>`
      - `LABEL_SUBJECT_KEY_FIELDS=<PIN_AT_P10_PHASE_ENTRY>`.
  - Build-plan status updated:
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`: `M7.A` marked complete, execution notes added.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: `M7.A` sub-phase checked; next action moved to `M7.B`.

* 2:45PM
  - Opened `M7.P8` deep-plan expansion before executing `M7.B`.
  - Reason:
    - current `P8.A..P8.D` plan has core lanes but needs fuller prep depth to avoid implicit checks during runtime execution.
  - Pre-change expansion targets:
    - explicit readiness/preflight lane matrix (`M7.A` carry-forward, substrate health, consumer posture, IAM/secret/evidence-write, rerun/rollback safety),
    - runtime-budget gates for each P8 sub-phase,
    - stronger deterministic execution sequence per `P8.A..P8.D`,
    - explicit fail-closed blocker closure rules before each transition.
  - Scope posture:
    - documentation-only expansion (no runtime/infra mutation in this step),
    - ownership boundaries unchanged (P8 remains RTDL core plane authority).

* 2:46PM
  - Completed `M7.P8` planning expansion (`P8.A..P8.D`) in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`.
  - Added execution-grade prep coverage:
    - pre-execution readiness matrix (carry-forward invariants, substrate stability, run-scope, topic materialization, IAM/secret/evidence-write, DB dependency),
    - runtime-budget gates per sub-phase and plane total,
    - rerun/rollback prep contract,
    - deeper per-phase entry/prep/execution sequencing and blocker taxonomy,
    - control-plane snapshot metadata contract and P8 blocker register.
  - Outcome:
    - `M7.P8` is planning-complete for execution entry (`P8.A` / `M7.B`), with fail-closed expectations explicit.
  - Runtime posture:
    - no infra/runtime mutation during this planning patch.

* 2:19PM
  - Executed Segment `2B` `POPT.4` integrated fast-lane lock on witness root:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt4_20260218_1412`
    - run id: `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`
  - Integrated runtime evidence artifact emitted:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_popt4_integrated_run1_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
    - movement vs POPT.0 baseline: `76.375s -> 15.642s` (`-79.52%`).
  - Added S5 replay hardening for shared-trace append case:
    - file: `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s5_router/runner.py`
    - behavior: `rng_trace_log` replay accepts exact-prefix equality when
      downstream S6 append exists; still fail-closed otherwise.
  - Replay witness captured on accepted optimization scope (`S0->S5`):
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_popt4_replay_scope_s0_s5_stdout.log`
    - PASS with idempotent skip evidence.
  - Structural non-regression checks remained PASS for `S0/S2/S6/S7/S8` on
    integrated run; S8 `_passed.flag` present.
  - Residual noted for freeze handoff:
    - full `S0->S8` replay still hits legacy `S6` idempotence code `2B-S6-080`
      (`segment2b_popt4_replay_run2_postfix_stdout.log`).

* 2:24PM
  - Noted and started remediation of residual full-replay idempotence failure
    `2B-S6-080` in `2B.S6`.
  - Root cause pinned in code:
    - S6 event + trace rows still use runtime `ts_utc`, so strict replay
      byte-equality fails on second run.
  - Approved execution path:
    - implement deterministic timestamp sequencing in `S6` anchored to S0
      `created_utc`, mirroring accepted S5 posture,
    - keep strict publish checks fail-closed,
    - run full `segment2b` publish + replay witness on
      `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt4_20260218_1412`.
  - Detailed pre-change decision trail appended in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`

* 2:35PM
  - Closed residual Segment `2B` full-replay idempotence failure in `S6`
    (`2B-S6-080`).
  - Code patch:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s6_edge_router/runner.py`
    - deterministic `ts_utc` sequencing added for S6 event + trace rows,
      anchored to S0 `created_utc`.
  - Full publish + replay witness (same run-id) completed with no S6 replay
    failures:
    - run1 log: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_s6fix_run1_stdout.log`
    - run2 log: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_s6fix_run2_replay_stdout.log`
    - replay evidence includes:
      - `rng_event_cdn_edge_pick already exists and is identical`
      - `rng_trace_log already includes append; skipping`
      - no `2B-S6-080`, no `2B-S6-081`.
  - Structural rails remained PASS (`S6` run-report, `S7` audit, `S8` bundle).
  - Summary artifact emitted:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_s6_idempotence_fix_summary_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`

* 2:49PM
  - Closed Segment `2B` `POPT.5` (optimization freeze handoff).
  - Created lock artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_popt5_lock_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_popt5_lock_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
  - Pruned superseded optimization roots:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt1_replay_20260218_134345`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt2_20260218_134742`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B_popt4_20260218_1412`
  - Prune evidence:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_popt5_prune_summary.json`
    - reclaimed: `39.904 GB`.
  - Retained active root for remediation entry:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B`
  - Explicit decision recorded: `GO_P0`.

* 3:06PM
  - Executed and closed Segment `2B` remediation `P0` (baseline authority + harness lock).
  - Added a dedicated baseline scorer:
    - `tools/score_segment2b_p0_baseline.py`
    - emits lineage pin, S1/S3/S4 hard-gate baseline table, roster posture, and
      baseline verdict artifact pair.
  - Emitted hard-gate baseline artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p0_baseline_metrics_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p0_baseline_metrics_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
  - Emitted runtime baseline artifacts for `P0`:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p0_runtime_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p0_runtime_baseline_c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92.md`
  - Baseline findings:
    - `S1` fails heterogeneity activation (`residual=0.0`, `top1-top2=0.0`);
    - `S3` is non-collapsed and passes activation proxies;
    - `S4` fails dominance/entropy gates (`max_p_group p50=0.9289`,
      `share max>=0.95=49.13%`, `entropy p50=0.2565`);
    - roster is not realism-grade (`horizon_span_days=1`, no repeated
      merchant-day arrivals), so verdict = `INVALID_FOR_GRADING`.
  - Updated planning/decision docs:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.build_plan.md`
      (`P0` DoD checked and closure record added),
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
      (full methodology + decision trail appended).

* 3:12PM
  - Opened Segment `2B` remediation `P1` execution lane (S1 heterogeneity activation).
  - Pre-change decision pinned:
    - policy-only `column` mode was rejected because `site_locations` lacks a
      suitable deterministic weight column,
    - accepted path: implement `profile_mixture_v2` policy + S1 code delta
      per remediation report section `5.2.1/5.3.1`.
  - Planned execution scope:
    - update `alias_layout_policy_v1` with `profile_mixture_v2` controls,
    - implement deterministic merchant-scoped mixture resolver in `S1`,
    - run staged candidate lane `S0->S1->S2`,
    - emit P1 score/lock artifacts and update plan/notes.

* 3:24PM
  - Executed platform `M7.B` (`P8.A`) RTDL readiness lane and applied fail-closed blocker handling.
  - First readiness snapshot run returned blockers:
    - `M7B-B2` (RTDL consumer-posture env not materialized in task definitions),
    - `M7B-B7` (topic-readiness probe schema mismatch; parser expected `topics_observed`, evidence uses `topics_present`).
  - Remediation applied:
    - patched Terraform to materialize pinned RTDL env handles:
      - `RTDL_CORE_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID=fraud-platform-dev-min-rtdl-core-v0`
      - `RTDL_CORE_OFFSET_COMMIT_POLICY=commit_after_durable_write`
    - files updated:
      - `infra/terraform/modules/demo/variables.tf`
      - `infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf`
      - `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo/variables.tf`
      - `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo/main.tf`
    - reapplied `infra/terraform/dev_min/demo` with pinned run scope.
    - updated probe parsing to consume `M2.F` topic-evidence schema (`topics_present`).
  - Re-executed `M7.B` readiness and closed PASS:
    - local snapshot:
      - `runs/dev_substrate/m7/20260218T141420Z/m7_b_rtdl_readiness_snapshot.json`
    - durable snapshot:
      - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_b_rtdl_readiness_snapshot.json`
    - result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers empty.
  - Plan/status updates:
    - `platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`: `P8.A` DoD + checklist marked complete with execution notes.
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`: `M7.B` DoD + phase checklist marked complete with execution notes.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M7 sub-phase progress updated (`M7.B` checked), next action moved to `M7.C`.

* 3:25PM
  - Executed platform `M7.C` (`P8.B`) offsets/caught-up closure and enforced fail-closed behavior.
  - Published run-scoped artifacts:
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/rtdl_core/offsets_snapshot.json`
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260213T214223Z/rtdl_core/caught_up.json`
  - Published control-plane snapshot:
    - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m7_20260218T141420Z/m7_c_rtdl_caught_up_snapshot.json`
  - Result: `overall_pass=false`; `M7.C` remains open.
  - Blocker reason:
    - active required Kafka topics are currently empty (`watermark_high=0` on all required partitions),
    - while run ingest basis (`ingest/kafka_offsets_snapshot.json`) remains non-zero from prior substrate epoch.
    - this is a stale-basis continuity drift, recorded as open `M7C-B5` (`M7C-B7` semantic in P8 branch).
  - Plan updates:
    - `platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`: open blocker register updated.
    - `platform.M7.build_plan.md`: open M7 blocker register updated.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: next action changed to close `M7C-B5` then rerun `M7.C`.

* 3:31PM
  - Closed Segment `2B` remediation `P1` on accepted candidate run:
    - run id: `c7e3f4f9715d4256b7802bdc28579d54`
    - root: `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B`
  - P1 implementation changes:
    - `config/layer1/2B/policy/alias_layout_policy_v1.json`
      - switched to `weight_source.mode=profile_mixture_v2`,
      - added `profile_mixture_v2` controls (bucketed mixture/alpha/caps),
      - bumped to `version_tag/policy_version=1.0.2`,
      - adjusted `quantisation_epsilon` to `1.2e-07`.
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s1_site_weights/runner.py`
      - implemented deterministic `profile_mixture_v2` resolver and
        provenance emission in S1 run-report samples.
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml`
      - added `profile_mixture_v2` property under `alias_layout_policy_v1`.
  - Candidate lane issues resolved:
    - fixed schema rejection `2B-S1-031`,
    - fixed stale-seal digest mismatch `2B-S2-022` by rerunning from clean
      staged roots with fresh `S0`,
    - fixed `2B-S1-052` by widening policy quantization epsilon.
  - Final P1 evidence artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p1_candidate_c7e3f4f9715d4256b7802bdc28579d54.json`

    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_2B/reports/segment2b_p1_lock_c7e3f4f9715d4256b7802bdc28579d54.md`
  - Measured movement vs P0 baseline (`c25...`):
    - residual median: `0.000000 -> 0.036163`,
    - top1-top2 gap median: `0.000000 -> 0.171117`,
    - HHI IQR: `0.067633 -> 0.270633`,
    - scorer verdict: `PASS_P1`.
  - S2 non-regression remained green:
    - `s2_run_report` summary `PASS` (`fail_count=0`).
  - Storage hygiene:
    - pruned superseded failed candidate roots:
      - `6f2b57a4e7fc4fe6b216fdcf0f87cb73`
      - `79c70dfc9aa44843bd4eb035192e3354`
      - `c983af9b3a4f4a38947fe8d37cbb77f2`
