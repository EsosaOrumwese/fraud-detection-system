* 12:40PM
  - Opened M7 planning lane by user direction.
  - Reviewed authority surfaces for P8/P9/P10 expansion:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M6.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`
  - Pre-change lock recorded in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Planned patch scope:
    - expand M7 migration/execution section in `platform.build_plan.md`,
    - create execution-grade deep plan file `platform.M7.build_plan.md`,
    - keep this step planning-only (no runtime/infra execution).

* 12:49PM
  - Started Segment `2B` remediation planning by user direction.
  - Read and aligned planning authority:
    - `docs/reports/eda/segment_2B/segment_2B_published_report.md`
    - `docs/reports/eda/segment_2B/segment_2B_remediation_report.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2B/state.2B.s0.expanded.md` through `state.2B.s8.expanded.md`
  - Created initial remediation build plan:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.build_plan.md`
  - Plan scope locked:
    - causal remediation order `S1 -> S3 -> S4 -> S5/gates`,
    - hard `B/B+` thresholds and cross-seed stability gates,
    - sequential rerun matrix with `S0` reseal rule on policy-byte changes,
    - runtime budgets + prune-before-run retention discipline,
    - phased DoD map `P0..P5`.
  - Appended decision trail in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
  - Execution posture for this step:
    - planning-only; no code-path remediation run executed.

* 12:52PM
  - Applied M7 planning expansion patch.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
      - M7 set to `ACTIVE`
      - M7 section expanded to execution-grade structure (`M7.A..M7.J`)
      - immediate next action moved to `M7.A` handle closure
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
      - added pre-change and post-change M7 planning entries
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.build_plan.md`
      - full deep plan for `P8..P10` with anti-cram lane coverage, blockers, DoD, and evidence contract.
  - Execution posture for this step:
    - planning-only; no runtime/infra actions.

* 12:58PM
  - Opened M7 branch-planning split by user direction.
  - Planned to create dedicated per-plane deep plans:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P8.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P9.build_plan.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M7.P10.build_plan.md`
  - Planned orchestrator alignment updates:
    - keep `platform.M7.build_plan.md` as integration/verdict authority,
    - wire plane docs from `platform.M7.build_plan.md` and `platform.build_plan.md`,
    - keep this change planning-only.
