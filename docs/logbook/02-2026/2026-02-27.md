## 2026-02-27 05:23:00 +00:00 - M11.D transform failure root cause fixed
- Strict rerun `22473716913` failed after transform launch due input-shape/content issue, not quota.
- CloudWatch logs showed batch transform read `test_labels.json` from test prefix and attempted CSV parse (415).
- Patched workflow to set transform S3 input URI to exact `test_features.csv` object key only.
- Keeping strict managed-transform mode enabled for next rerun.
## 2026-02-27 05:22:34 +00:00 - With-icons Mermaid set colorized with icon packs
- Reworked with_icons Mermaid views to presentation color posture using class-based palette and colored lane boundaries.
- Kept real icon-pack nodes (Iconify): simple-icons + mdi.
- Re-rendered with_icons SVG/PNG for executive, engineering, and audit views.
- Performed SVG QC pass: no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens.
- Verified visual output via PNG previews for all three with_icons views.


## 2026-02-27 05:34:00 +00:00 - M11D-AD1 cleared with strict managed transform
- Quotas confirmed non-zero for c5/c4 transform lanes.
- Strict run passed: https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22473966183.
- Execution id: `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Post-fix posture: `eval_mode=managed_batch_transform`, advisories empty, `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.E_READY`.
- Advisory `M11D-AD1` marked cleared; next lane is `M11.E`.
## 2026-02-27 05:38:29 +00:00 - Added dedicated dev_min network topology views
- Added new dev_min network topology view to both sets:
  - without_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
  - with_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
- View content is pinned to Terraform-defined network resources in infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf:
  - aws_vpc.demo, aws_internet_gateway.demo,
  - aws_subnet.public[*], aws_route_table.public, aws_route.internet, aws_route_table_association.public[*],
  - aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db,
  - aws_db_subnet_group.demo, aws_db_instance.runtime,
  - ECS runtime-probe/daemon network placement (public subnets + app SG + assign_public_ip=true).
- Included posture notes in topology:
  - no NAT gateway provisioned,
  - no ALB/NLB provisioned.
- Rendered Graphviz + Mermaid SVG/PNG for both sets and ran SVG quality checks (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).
