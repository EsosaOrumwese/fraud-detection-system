## 2026-02-27 05:23:00 +00:00 - M11.D transform failure root cause fixed
- Strict rerun `22473716913` failed after transform launch due input-shape/content issue, not quota.
- CloudWatch logs showed batch transform read `test_labels.json` from test prefix and attempted CSV parse (415).
- Patched workflow to set transform S3 input URI to exact `test_features.csv` object key only.
- Keeping strict managed-transform mode enabled for next rerun.
## 2026-02-27 05:22:34 +00:00 - With-icons Mermaid set colorized with icon packs
- Reworked with_icons Mermaid views to presentation color posture using class-based palette and colored lane boundaries.
- Kept real icon-pack nodes (Iconify): simple-icons + mdi.
- Re-rendered with_icons SVG/PNG for executive, engineering, and audit views.
- Performed SVG QC pass: no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens.
- Verified visual output via PNG previews for all three with_icons views.


## 2026-02-27 05:34:00 +00:00 - M11D-AD1 cleared with strict managed transform
- Quotas confirmed non-zero for c5/c4 transform lanes.
- Strict run passed: https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22473966183.
- Execution id: `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Post-fix posture: `eval_mode=managed_batch_transform`, advisories empty, `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.E_READY`.
- Advisory `M11D-AD1` marked cleared; next lane is `M11.E`.
## 2026-02-27 05:38:29 +00:00 - Added dedicated dev_min network topology views
- Added new dev_min network topology view to both sets:
  - without_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
  - with_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
- View content is pinned to Terraform-defined network resources in infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf:
  - aws_vpc.demo, aws_internet_gateway.demo,
  - aws_subnet.public[*], aws_route_table.public, aws_route.internet, aws_route_table_association.public[*],
  - aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db,
  - aws_db_subnet_group.demo, aws_db_instance.runtime,
  - ECS runtime-probe/daemon network placement (public subnets + app SG + assign_public_ip=true).
- Included posture notes in topology:
  - no NAT gateway provisioned,
  - no ALB/NLB provisioned.
- Rendered Graphviz + Mermaid SVG/PNG for both sets and ran SVG quality checks (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:04:34 +00:00 - M11.E plan expanded to execution-grade fail-closed contract
- Expanded `M11.E` in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M11.build_plan.md` from generic notes to four explicit sequential lanes (`M11.E.A`..`M11.E.D`).
- Added explicit `M11-B5` subcodes for unresolved policy handles, evidence ingest failure, leakage fail, performance fail, stability fail, and publication failure.
- Pinned deterministic adjudication order: compatibility -> leakage -> performance -> stability.
- Updated master next-action in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md` to require policy-handle closure before M11.E execution.
- Execution not started in this step; this is planning closure only.

## 2026-02-27 06:08:00 +00:00 - M11.E handle names made explicit
- Replaced generic M11.E policy-key wording with explicit handle names (`MF_EVAL_*`) in deep plan and master next-action pointer.
- This keeps M11.E entry fail-closed with a concrete unresolved handle set.

## 2026-02-27 06:13:00 +00:00 - M11.E execution started (handle pin + managed workflow extension)
- Began M11.E lane with fail-closed decision: pin MF_EVAL_* handles first, then add managed E support in .github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml, then execute against authoritative M11.D output.
## 2026-02-27 06:07:40 +00:00 - Added unified architecture renderer with Mermaid ELK support
- Added scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1.
- Script renders dev_min architecture assets for with_icons / without_icons sets:
  - Graphviz DOT -> SVG/PNG
  - Mermaid MMD -> SVG/PNG
- Added Mermaid layout switch: -MermaidLayout dagre|elk (ELK enables adaptive layout).
- Added Graphviz engine switch: -GraphvizEngine dot|neato|fdp|sfdp|twopi|circo.
- Updated docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/README.md with one-command usage and ELK example.
- Validation run:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set with_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme default
  - Render succeeded; Mermaid SVG QC pass (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:21:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed lane implemented
- Pinned M11.E policy handles in dev_full registry.
- Extended `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml` to support subphase `E` end-to-end with fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M11-B5.1..B5.6`).
- Next step: dispatch managed M11.E run against authoritative M11.D execution and validate `M11.F_READY`.
## 2026-02-27 06:11:01 +00:00 - Renderer script cleanup fix validated
- Fixed render script temp-folder cleanup branch to handle empty Get-ChildItem result safely via array cast.
- Validation run passed:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set without_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme neutral
- Confirmed no residual docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/_render directory after run.

## 2026-02-27 06:24:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed execution closed green
- Dispatched workflow `dev-full-m11-managed` (run `22475130190`) with `m11_subphase=E` and upstream `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Run passed (`overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.F_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_F`, `blocker_count=0`).
- Published M11.E evidence under `evidence/dev_full/run_control/m11e_eval_gate_20260227T061316Z/` plus leakage provenance publication under run-scoped learning MF path.
- Updated M11 deep plan and master next-action pointer to M11.F.

## 2026-02-27 06:33:00 +00:00 - M11.F plan expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded M11.F in deep plan to four explicit lanes (handle closure, upstream integrity, managed MLflow commit, publication).
- Added `M11-B6` subcode taxonomy and tightened DoD to require explicit MLflow run identifiers and `M11.G_READY`.
## 2026-02-27 06:19:46 +00:00 - Platform design folder structure consolidation
- Consolidated dev_min design assets under environment-scoped folder:
  - moved docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/architecture
  - moved docs/design/platform/terraform/dev_min -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/terraform
- Updated script defaults to match new structure:
  - scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 InputRoot default -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/architecture
  - scripts/design/run_terravision_dev_min.ps1 OutputRoot default -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/terraform
- Added platform index map:
  - docs/design/platform/README.md
- Added compatibility stub for legacy terraform path:
  - docs/design/platform/terraform/README.md
- Updated architecture README wording:
  - with_icons description now reflects Iconify icon-pack logos
  - view count updated to include network topology view
- Sanity check:
  - render script executes successfully on new default InputRoot.

## 2026-02-27 06:43:00 +00:00 - M11.F managed workflow lane wired
- Extended `dev_full_m11_managed.yml` with subphase `F` execution path.
- Added MLflow lineage commit + provenance closure checks and fail-closed blocker mapping (`M11-B6.*`).
- Prepared to dispatch M11.F using upstream M11.E pass execution `m11e_eval_gate_20260227T061316Z`.

## 2026-02-27 06:49:00 +00:00 - M11.F remediation patch prepared
- Diagnosed first M11.F failure as MLflow endpoint 404 (`M11-B6.4`).
- Patched workflow with endpoint fallback: `/api/2.0/mlflow/*` then `/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/*` on 404.
- Keeping fail-closed behavior for all non-404 API errors; rerun next.

## 2026-02-27 06:57:00 +00:00 - M11.F remediation refined after direct API diagnostics
- Verified workspace/token validity via Databricks workspace/clusters APIs.
- Confirmed MLflow `get-by-name` returns 404 for missing experiment; create/run endpoints are functional.
- Patched workflow to treat lookup 404 as expected not-found and proceed to experiment creation.

## 2026-02-27 07:03:00 +00:00 - M11.F experiment resolution remediated
- Added robust experiment id resolution in M11.F workflow (`get-by-name` -> search -> create -> re-search).
- This patch targets recurring `M11-B6.4` caused by lookup/create mismatch on Databricks MLflow surface.

## 2026-02-27 07:09:00 +00:00 - M11.F paginated experiment search patch
- Patched M11.F lane to paginate MLflow experiment search (`next_page_token`) so experiment lookup is not truncated to first page.
- Applied same search helper in create-failure retry path.

## 2026-02-27 07:16:00 +00:00 - M11.F experiment-path fallback remediation
- Confirmed primary `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_PATH` is non-creatable on Databricks workspace.
- Added deterministic fallback to child path `<primary>/mlflow_exp_v0` with explicit note/tag publication.
- Lane remains fail-closed if both candidate paths fail.

## 2026-02-27 06:40:00 +00:00 - M11.F closed green on managed lane
- Run `22475770850` succeeded with execution `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T063855Z`.
- Gate result: `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.G_READY`, `blocker_count=0`.
- MLflow lineage committed with experiment `2974219164213255` and run `f8f23e9286744e4188992d5d929d477f` (`FINISHED`).
- Recorded explicit note that primary experiment path handle was non-creatable and fallback path was used deterministically.

## 2026-02-27 07:43:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict no-fallback rerun initiated
- Applied strict M11.F resolver patch (no experiment-path fallback) in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml`.
- Prepared canonical registry handle pin locally:
  - `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_PATH=/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full/mlflow_exp_v0`.
- Workflow-only commit pushed for managed rerun:
  - `576d13ed` (`ci: enforce strict m11f experiment-path resolution`).

## 2026-02-27 07:45:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict rerun failed closed (`M11-B6.4`)
- Run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22477445213`
- Execution: `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T074421Z`
- Result: `overall_pass=false`, `blocker_count=1`, `next_gate=HOLD_REMEDIATE`.
- Blocker: `M11-B6.4` with `api_error=RuntimeError:experiment_id_missing`.
- Confirmed runtime used stale remote handle path (`/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full`).
- Required next action: publish canonical handle pin to remote and rerun M11.F strict lane before M11.G.

## 2026-02-27 07:56:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict no-fallback closure achieved
- Canonical handle pin committed/pushed:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - commit `7dd77599`.
- Authoritative strict run:
  - `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22477775337`
  - execution `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T075634Z`
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M11.G_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_G`.
- Lineage proof:
  - experiment path `/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full/mlflow_exp_v0`
  - experiment id `2974219164213255`
  - run id `446edf03415548d0944b689e03168795`
  - run status `FINISHED`.
## 2026-02-27 08:05:27 +00:00 - Dev_min architecture ELK rerender + Graphviz icon verification
- Re-ran architecture renderer after Docker restore:
  - command: `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set all -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme neutral`
  - result: successful render for both `with_icons` and `without_icons` sets (Mermaid + Graphviz outputs regenerated).
- Verified Graphviz icon posture in `with_icons` dot sources:
  - files use bracketed semantic tags (for example `[S3]`, `[DDB]`, `[KAFKA]`, `[ECS]`) in labels.
  - no embedded image/icon attributes are present in `.graphviz.dot`; therefore Graphviz output remains text-badge style rather than logo-icon style.
- ELK scope note:
  - ELK applies to Mermaid layout (`defaultRenderer=elk`) only.
  - Graphviz layout remains `dot` unless engine changed explicitly.

## 2026-02-27 08:00:00 +00:00 - M11.G planning closure before coding
- Confirmed strict M11.F upstream pass (`m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T075634Z`) as entry basis.
- Decided to implement M11.G as managed subphase in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml` (no local closure path).
- Pinned M11.G deliverables for execution:
  - candidate bundle publish (`MF_CANDIDATE_BUNDLE_PATH_PATTERN`),
  - `m11g_candidate_bundle_snapshot.json`,
  - `m11_model_operability_report.json`,
  - `m11g_blocker_register.json`,
  - `m11g_execution_summary.json`.
- Pinned fail-closed blocker mapping for M11.G under `M11-B7.*`.

## 2026-02-27 08:08:00 +00:00 - M11.G managed lane implemented
- Extended `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml` for subphase `G`.
- Added inputs: `upstream_m11f_execution`, `m11g_execution_id`.
- Added fail-closed M11.G step:
  - candidate bundle publication,
  - model operability report,
  - run-control snapshot/blocker/summary publication,
  - `M11-B7.*` blocker taxonomy.
- Expanded deep plan section for M11.G to lane-level execution contract before dispatch.

## 2026-02-27 08:12:00 +00:00 - M11.G closed green (managed)
- Run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22478216340`
- Execution: `m11g_candidate_bundle_20260227T081200Z`
- Result: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M11.H_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_H`.
- Candidate bundle published:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260223T184232Z/learning/mf/candidate_bundle.json`
- Operability report published and pass:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-full-evidence/evidence/dev_full/run_control/m11g_candidate_bundle_20260227T081200Z/m11_model_operability_report.json`
- Package group status:
  - `fraud-platform-dev-full-models` materialized (`Completed`).
