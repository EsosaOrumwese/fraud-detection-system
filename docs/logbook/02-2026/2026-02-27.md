## 2026-02-27 05:23:00 +00:00 - M11.D transform failure root cause fixed
- Strict rerun `22473716913` failed after transform launch due input-shape/content issue, not quota.
- CloudWatch logs showed batch transform read `test_labels.json` from test prefix and attempted CSV parse (415).
- Patched workflow to set transform S3 input URI to exact `test_features.csv` object key only.
- Keeping strict managed-transform mode enabled for next rerun.
## 2026-02-27 05:22:34 +00:00 - With-icons Mermaid set colorized with icon packs
- Reworked with_icons Mermaid views to presentation color posture using class-based palette and colored lane boundaries.
- Kept real icon-pack nodes (Iconify): simple-icons + mdi.
- Re-rendered with_icons SVG/PNG for executive, engineering, and audit views.
- Performed SVG QC pass: no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens.
- Verified visual output via PNG previews for all three with_icons views.
