## 2026-02-27 05:23:00 +00:00 - M11.D transform failure root cause fixed
- Strict rerun `22473716913` failed after transform launch due input-shape/content issue, not quota.
- CloudWatch logs showed batch transform read `test_labels.json` from test prefix and attempted CSV parse (415).
- Patched workflow to set transform S3 input URI to exact `test_features.csv` object key only.
- Keeping strict managed-transform mode enabled for next rerun.
## 2026-02-27 05:22:34 +00:00 - With-icons Mermaid set colorized with icon packs
- Reworked with_icons Mermaid views to presentation color posture using class-based palette and colored lane boundaries.
- Kept real icon-pack nodes (Iconify): simple-icons + mdi.
- Re-rendered with_icons SVG/PNG for executive, engineering, and audit views.
- Performed SVG QC pass: no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens.
- Verified visual output via PNG previews for all three with_icons views.


## 2026-02-27 05:34:00 +00:00 - M11D-AD1 cleared with strict managed transform
- Quotas confirmed non-zero for c5/c4 transform lanes.
- Strict run passed: https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22473966183.
- Execution id: `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Post-fix posture: `eval_mode=managed_batch_transform`, advisories empty, `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.E_READY`.
- Advisory `M11D-AD1` marked cleared; next lane is `M11.E`.
## 2026-02-27 05:38:29 +00:00 - Added dedicated dev_min network topology views
- Added new dev_min network topology view to both sets:
  - without_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
  - with_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
- View content is pinned to Terraform-defined network resources in infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf:
  - aws_vpc.demo, aws_internet_gateway.demo,
  - aws_subnet.public[*], aws_route_table.public, aws_route.internet, aws_route_table_association.public[*],
  - aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db,
  - aws_db_subnet_group.demo, aws_db_instance.runtime,
  - ECS runtime-probe/daemon network placement (public subnets + app SG + assign_public_ip=true).
- Included posture notes in topology:
  - no NAT gateway provisioned,
  - no ALB/NLB provisioned.
- Rendered Graphviz + Mermaid SVG/PNG for both sets and ran SVG quality checks (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:04:34 +00:00 - M11.E plan expanded to execution-grade fail-closed contract
- Expanded `M11.E` in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M11.build_plan.md` from generic notes to four explicit sequential lanes (`M11.E.A`..`M11.E.D`).
- Added explicit `M11-B5` subcodes for unresolved policy handles, evidence ingest failure, leakage fail, performance fail, stability fail, and publication failure.
- Pinned deterministic adjudication order: compatibility -> leakage -> performance -> stability.
- Updated master next-action in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md` to require policy-handle closure before M11.E execution.
- Execution not started in this step; this is planning closure only.

## 2026-02-27 06:08:00 +00:00 - M11.E handle names made explicit
- Replaced generic M11.E policy-key wording with explicit handle names (`MF_EVAL_*`) in deep plan and master next-action pointer.
- This keeps M11.E entry fail-closed with a concrete unresolved handle set.

## 2026-02-27 06:13:00 +00:00 - M11.E execution started (handle pin + managed workflow extension)
- Began M11.E lane with fail-closed decision: pin MF_EVAL_* handles first, then add managed E support in .github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml, then execute against authoritative M11.D output.
## 2026-02-27 06:07:40 +00:00 - Added unified architecture renderer with Mermaid ELK support
- Added scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1.
- Script renders dev_min architecture assets for with_icons / without_icons sets:
  - Graphviz DOT -> SVG/PNG
  - Mermaid MMD -> SVG/PNG
- Added Mermaid layout switch: -MermaidLayout dagre|elk (ELK enables adaptive layout).
- Added Graphviz engine switch: -GraphvizEngine dot|neato|fdp|sfdp|twopi|circo.
- Updated docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/README.md with one-command usage and ELK example.
- Validation run:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set with_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme default
  - Render succeeded; Mermaid SVG QC pass (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:21:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed lane implemented
- Pinned M11.E policy handles in dev_full registry.
- Extended `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml` to support subphase `E` end-to-end with fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M11-B5.1..B5.6`).
- Next step: dispatch managed M11.E run against authoritative M11.D execution and validate `M11.F_READY`.
## 2026-02-27 06:11:01 +00:00 - Renderer script cleanup fix validated
- Fixed render script temp-folder cleanup branch to handle empty Get-ChildItem result safely via array cast.
- Validation run passed:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set without_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme neutral
- Confirmed no residual docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/_render directory after run.

## 2026-02-27 06:24:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed execution closed green
- Dispatched workflow `dev-full-m11-managed` (run `22475130190`) with `m11_subphase=E` and upstream `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Run passed (`overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.F_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_F`, `blocker_count=0`).
- Published M11.E evidence under `evidence/dev_full/run_control/m11e_eval_gate_20260227T061316Z/` plus leakage provenance publication under run-scoped learning MF path.
- Updated M11 deep plan and master next-action pointer to M11.F.
