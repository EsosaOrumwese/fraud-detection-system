
## 2026-02-27 05:23:00 +00:00 - M11.D transform failure root cause fixed
- Strict rerun `22473716913` failed after transform launch due input-shape/content issue, not quota.
- CloudWatch logs showed batch transform read `test_labels.json` from test prefix and attempted CSV parse (415).
- Patched workflow to set transform S3 input URI to exact `test_features.csv` object key only.
- Keeping strict managed-transform mode enabled for next rerun.
## 2026-02-27 05:22:34 +00:00 - With-icons Mermaid set colorized with icon packs
- Reworked with_icons Mermaid views to presentation color posture using class-based palette and colored lane boundaries.
- Kept real icon-pack nodes (Iconify): simple-icons + mdi.
- Re-rendered with_icons SVG/PNG for executive, engineering, and audit views.
- Performed SVG QC pass: no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens.
- Verified visual output via PNG previews for all three with_icons views.


## 2026-02-27 05:34:00 +00:00 - M11D-AD1 cleared with strict managed transform
- Quotas confirmed non-zero for c5/c4 transform lanes.
- Strict run passed: https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22473966183.
- Execution id: `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Post-fix posture: `eval_mode=managed_batch_transform`, advisories empty, `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.E_READY`.
- Advisory `M11D-AD1` marked cleared; next lane is `M11.E`.
## 2026-02-27 05:38:29 +00:00 - Added dedicated dev_min network topology views
- Added new dev_min network topology view to both sets:
  - without_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
  - with_icons/dev_min_network_topology.*
- View content is pinned to Terraform-defined network resources in infra/terraform/modules/demo/main.tf:
  - aws_vpc.demo, aws_internet_gateway.demo,
  - aws_subnet.public[*], aws_route_table.public, aws_route.internet, aws_route_table_association.public[*],
  - aws_security_group.app, aws_security_group.db,
  - aws_db_subnet_group.demo, aws_db_instance.runtime,
  - ECS runtime-probe/daemon network placement (public subnets + app SG + assign_public_ip=true).
- Included posture notes in topology:
  - no NAT gateway provisioned,
  - no ALB/NLB provisioned.
- Rendered Graphviz + Mermaid SVG/PNG for both sets and ran SVG quality checks (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:04:34 +00:00 - M11.E plan expanded to execution-grade fail-closed contract
- Expanded `M11.E` in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M11.build_plan.md` from generic notes to four explicit sequential lanes (`M11.E.A`..`M11.E.D`).
- Added explicit `M11-B5` subcodes for unresolved policy handles, evidence ingest failure, leakage fail, performance fail, stability fail, and publication failure.
- Pinned deterministic adjudication order: compatibility -> leakage -> performance -> stability.
- Updated master next-action in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md` to require policy-handle closure before M11.E execution.
- Execution not started in this step; this is planning closure only.

## 2026-02-27 06:08:00 +00:00 - M11.E handle names made explicit
- Replaced generic M11.E policy-key wording with explicit handle names (`MF_EVAL_*`) in deep plan and master next-action pointer.
- This keeps M11.E entry fail-closed with a concrete unresolved handle set.

## 2026-02-27 06:13:00 +00:00 - M11.E execution started (handle pin + managed workflow extension)
- Began M11.E lane with fail-closed decision: pin MF_EVAL_* handles first, then add managed E support in .github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml, then execute against authoritative M11.D output.
## 2026-02-27 06:07:40 +00:00 - Added unified architecture renderer with Mermaid ELK support
- Added scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1.
- Script renders dev_min architecture assets for with_icons / without_icons sets:
  - Graphviz DOT -> SVG/PNG
  - Mermaid MMD -> SVG/PNG
- Added Mermaid layout switch: -MermaidLayout dagre|elk (ELK enables adaptive layout).
- Added Graphviz engine switch: -GraphvizEngine dot|neato|fdp|sfdp|twopi|circo.
- Updated docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/README.md with one-command usage and ELK example.
- Validation run:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set with_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme default
  - Render succeeded; Mermaid SVG QC pass (no literal \\n artifacts, no NaN tokens).

## 2026-02-27 06:21:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed lane implemented
- Pinned M11.E policy handles in dev_full registry.
- Extended `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml` to support subphase `E` end-to-end with fail-closed blocker taxonomy (`M11-B5.1..B5.6`).
- Next step: dispatch managed M11.E run against authoritative M11.D execution and validate `M11.F_READY`.
## 2026-02-27 06:11:01 +00:00 - Renderer script cleanup fix validated
- Fixed render script temp-folder cleanup branch to handle empty Get-ChildItem result safely via array cast.
- Validation run passed:
  - pwsh ./scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set without_icons -SkipGraphviz -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme neutral
- Confirmed no residual docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture/_render directory after run.

## 2026-02-27 06:24:00 +00:00 - M11.E managed execution closed green
- Dispatched workflow `dev-full-m11-managed` (run `22475130190`) with `m11_subphase=E` and upstream `m11d_train_eval_execution_20260227T052312Z`.
- Run passed (`overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.F_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_F`, `blocker_count=0`).
- Published M11.E evidence under `evidence/dev_full/run_control/m11e_eval_gate_20260227T061316Z/` plus leakage provenance publication under run-scoped learning MF path.
- Updated M11 deep plan and master next-action pointer to M11.F.

## 2026-02-27 06:33:00 +00:00 - M11.F plan expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded M11.F in deep plan to four explicit lanes (handle closure, upstream integrity, managed MLflow commit, publication).
- Added `M11-B6` subcode taxonomy and tightened DoD to require explicit MLflow run identifiers and `M11.G_READY`.
## 2026-02-27 06:19:46 +00:00 - Platform design folder structure consolidation
- Consolidated dev_min design assets under environment-scoped folder:
  - moved docs/design/platform/dev_min_architecture -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/architecture
  - moved docs/design/platform/terraform/dev_min -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/terraform
- Updated script defaults to match new structure:
  - scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 InputRoot default -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/architecture
  - scripts/design/run_terravision_dev_min.ps1 OutputRoot default -> docs/design/platform/dev_min/terraform
- Added platform index map:
  - docs/design/platform/README.md
- Added compatibility stub for legacy terraform path:
  - docs/design/platform/terraform/README.md
- Updated architecture README wording:
  - with_icons description now reflects Iconify icon-pack logos
  - view count updated to include network topology view
- Sanity check:
  - render script executes successfully on new default InputRoot.

## 2026-02-27 06:43:00 +00:00 - M11.F managed workflow lane wired
- Extended `dev_full_m11_managed.yml` with subphase `F` execution path.
- Added MLflow lineage commit + provenance closure checks and fail-closed blocker mapping (`M11-B6.*`).
- Prepared to dispatch M11.F using upstream M11.E pass execution `m11e_eval_gate_20260227T061316Z`.

## 2026-02-27 06:49:00 +00:00 - M11.F remediation patch prepared
- Diagnosed first M11.F failure as MLflow endpoint 404 (`M11-B6.4`).
- Patched workflow with endpoint fallback: `/api/2.0/mlflow/*` then `/api/2.0/preview/mlflow/*` on 404.
- Keeping fail-closed behavior for all non-404 API errors; rerun next.

## 2026-02-27 06:57:00 +00:00 - M11.F remediation refined after direct API diagnostics
- Verified workspace/token validity via Databricks workspace/clusters APIs.
- Confirmed MLflow `get-by-name` returns 404 for missing experiment; create/run endpoints are functional.
- Patched workflow to treat lookup 404 as expected not-found and proceed to experiment creation.

## 2026-02-27 07:03:00 +00:00 - M11.F experiment resolution remediated
- Added robust experiment id resolution in M11.F workflow (`get-by-name` -> search -> create -> re-search).
- This patch targets recurring `M11-B6.4` caused by lookup/create mismatch on Databricks MLflow surface.

## 2026-02-27 07:09:00 +00:00 - M11.F paginated experiment search patch
- Patched M11.F lane to paginate MLflow experiment search (`next_page_token`) so experiment lookup is not truncated to first page.
- Applied same search helper in create-failure retry path.

## 2026-02-27 07:16:00 +00:00 - M11.F experiment-path fallback remediation
- Confirmed primary `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_PATH` is non-creatable on Databricks workspace.
- Added deterministic fallback to child path `<primary>/mlflow_exp_v0` with explicit note/tag publication.
- Lane remains fail-closed if both candidate paths fail.

## 2026-02-27 06:40:00 +00:00 - M11.F closed green on managed lane
- Run `22475770850` succeeded with execution `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T063855Z`.
- Gate result: `overall_pass=true`, `next_gate=M11.G_READY`, `blocker_count=0`.
- MLflow lineage committed with experiment `2974219164213255` and run `f8f23e9286744e4188992d5d929d477f` (`FINISHED`).
- Recorded explicit note that primary experiment path handle was non-creatable and fallback path was used deterministically.

## 2026-02-27 07:43:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict no-fallback rerun initiated
- Applied strict M11.F resolver patch (no experiment-path fallback) in `.github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml`.
- Prepared canonical registry handle pin locally:
  - `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_PATH=/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full/mlflow_exp_v0`.
- Workflow-only commit pushed for managed rerun:
  - `576d13ed` (`ci: enforce strict m11f experiment-path resolution`).

## 2026-02-27 07:45:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict rerun failed closed (`M11-B6.4`)
- Run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22477445213`
- Execution: `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T074421Z`
- Result: `overall_pass=false`, `blocker_count=1`, `next_gate=HOLD_REMEDIATE`.
- Blocker: `M11-B6.4` with `api_error=RuntimeError:experiment_id_missing`.
- Confirmed runtime used stale remote handle path (`/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full`).
- Required next action: publish canonical handle pin to remote and rerun M11.F strict lane before M11.G.

## 2026-02-27 07:56:00 +00:00 - M11.F strict no-fallback closure achieved
- Canonical handle pin committed/pushed:
  - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - commit `7dd77599`.
- Authoritative strict run:
  - `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22477775337`
  - execution `m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T075634Z`
  - `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M11.G_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M11_G`.
- Lineage proof:
  - experiment path `/Shared/fraud-platform/dev_full/mlflow_exp_v0`
  - experiment id `2974219164213255`
  - run id `446edf03415548d0944b689e03168795`
  - run status `FINISHED`.
## 2026-02-27 08:05:27 +00:00 - Dev_min architecture ELK rerender + Graphviz icon verification
- Re-ran architecture renderer after Docker restore:
  - command: `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/design/render_dev_min_architecture.ps1 -Set all -MermaidLayout elk -MermaidTheme neutral`
  - result: successful render for both `with_icons` and `without_icons` sets (Mermaid + Graphviz outputs regenerated).
- Verified Graphviz icon posture in `with_icons` dot sources:
  - files use bracketed semantic tags (for example `[S3]`, `[DDB]`, `[KAFKA]`, `[ECS]`) in labels.
  - no embedded image/icon attributes are present in `.graphviz.dot`; therefore Graphviz output remains text-badge style rather than logo-icon style.
- ELK scope note:
  - ELK applies to Mermaid layout (`defaultRenderer=elk`) only.
  - Graphviz layout remains `dot` unless engine changed explicitly.

## 2026-02-27 08:00:00 +00:00 - M11.G planning closure before coding
- Confirmed strict M11.F upstream pass (`m11f_mlflow_lineage_20260227T075634Z`) as entry basis.

- Added fail-closed M11.G step:
  - candidate bundle publication,
  - model operability report,
  - run-control snapshot/blocker/summary publication,
  - `M11-B7.*` blocker taxonomy.

## 2026-02-27 08:16:00 +00:00 - M11.H planning closure before coding
- Confirmed M11.G pass entry basis: `m11g_candidate_bundle_20260227T081200Z`.
- Planned managed `M11.H` lane in `dev_full_m11_managed.yml` with fail-closed `M11-B8.*` taxonomy.
- Planned outputs include reproducibility report, safe-disable/rollback snapshot, blocker register, execution summary, and run-scoped rollback drill publication.

## 2026-02-27 08:50:39 +00:00 - M11.H workflow lane implemented (pre-dispatch)
- Implemented Execute M11.H (managed) in .github/workflows/dev_full_m11_managed.yml.

## 2026-02-27 09:03:11 +00:00 - Graphviz with-icons upgraded to local icon-pack images
- Added reusable icon-pack tooling under `scripts/design/`:
  - `fetch_graphviz_iconpack.ps1` (downloads icon set from Iconify with explicit dark color)
  - `convert_graphviz_iconpack_to_png.ps1` (converts SVG icon pack to PNG via Docker ImageMagick)
  - `apply_graphviz_icons_to_with_icons_dot.ps1` (patches with_icons Graphviz DOT nodes with icon image attributes)
- Added icon assets under `docs/design/platform/assets/iconpack/`.

## 2026-02-27 09:35:52 +00:00 - M11.I plan lock before wiring
- Locked deterministic rollup strategy: resolve A..H from M11.H upstream chain only (no latest-run heuristics).
- Locked pass contract per phase summary: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, expected `next_gate` values.
- Locked M11.I outputs: `m11i_p14_gate_verdict.json`, `m12_handoff_pack.json`, blocker register, execution summary.

- User requested planning expansion for M12 in both main and deep build plans.
- Captured pre-edit gaps:
  - stale deep-plan line still says blocked on M11 closure,
  - missing explicit managed execution-lane prerequisite for M12,
  - thin runtime budget and fail-closed subphase contracts for M12.
- Authority references loaded for alignment:
  - `dev_full_platform_green_v0_run_process_flow.md` P15 contract,
  - `dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` promotion/rollback evidence handles and learning registry topic handle.
- Next step: patch `platform.build_plan.md` and `platform.M12.build_plan.md` only (planning expansion, no execution yet).

## 2026-02-27 11:23:10 +00:00 - M12 planning expansion completed
- Expanded `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.build_plan.md`:
  - set M12 status to `ACTIVE`,
  - added M12 planning posture and explicit blocker families (`M12-B0..M12-B12`),
  - added progression snapshot and updated next action to close `M12-B0` first.
- Rebuilt `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M12.build_plan.md` into execution-grade depth:
  - added concrete entry contract tied to M11 closure evidence,
  - added managed-lane prerequisite and explicit `M12-B0`,
  - expanded each subphase (`M12.A..M12.J`) with entry conditions, checks, blockers, runtime budgets, and DoDs,
  - aligned artifact/path contract to pinned handles and P15 authority semantics.
- No execution dispatch performed in this step; planning-only update.

## 2026-02-27 11:26:05 +00:00 - Status truth-alignment correction
- Corrected stale `M11` status in `platform.build_plan.md` from `ACTIVE` to `DONE` during final M12 planning validation pass.
- Reason: M11 closure evidence is already green and M12 entry depends on that truth.

## 2026-02-27 11:35:10 +00:00 - M12-B0 workflow materialized (pre-dispatch)
- Added `.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml` as single managed M12 lane.
- Workflow supports `m12_subphase` routing for `A..J` with deterministic execution-id naming.
- Current mode is explicitly `materialization_check` to close `M12-B0` before M12.A execution.
- B0 lane validates upstream M11.J readiness and publishes materialization + dispatchability snapshots with blocker/summary artifacts.
- Next step: workflow-only commit/push, dispatch proof run, and close `M12-B0` if green.

## 2026-02-27 11:38:42 +00:00 - M12-B0 dispatch blocker
- Workflow-only commit pushed on `migrate-dev`:
  - `68374ea03` (`.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml`).
- Dispatch attempt failed:
  - `gh workflow run dev_full_m12_managed.yml --ref migrate-dev ...`
  - error: `HTTP 404 workflow ... not found on the default branch`.
- Result: `M12-B0` cannot close until workflow is promoted to default branch and re-dispatched.

## 2026-02-27 11:59:20 +00:00 - M12-B0 closed green
- Workflow-only promotion path executed:
  - branch: `ops/m12-workflow-only` (temporary, based on `origin/main`),
  - PR merged: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/pull/68`.
- Managed proof run on default branch:
  - run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22485281434`

- M12 next actionable lane is now `M12.A`.

## 2026-02-27 12:07:25 +00:00 - M12.A execution plan lock
- Confirmed `M12-B0` is green, but current workflow mode only supports `materialization_check`.
- Planned patch: add `m12a_execute` mode to `dev_full_m12_managed.yml` with fail-closed `M12-B1` logic.
- Planned M12.A checks:
  - upstream `M11.J` pass posture validation,
  - required P15 handle closure validation (`missing/blank/TO_PIN` fail),
  - emit `m12a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`, blocker register, execution summary to local + durable.
- Planned pass posture: `next_gate=M12.B_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_B`.

## 2026-02-27 12:13:40 +00:00 - M12.A workflow wiring complete (pre-dispatch)
- Extended `dev_full_m12_managed.yml` with `execution_mode=m12a_execute`.
- Added managed M12.A step with fail-closed `M12-B1` checks:
  - upstream M11.J readiness + run-scope checks,
  - required handle closure checks (missing/blank/`TO_PIN` fails).
- Added artifact emission for M12.A closure:
  - `m12a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`,
  - `m12a_blocker_register.json`,
  - `m12a_execution_summary.json`.
- Next step: workflow-only commit/push and dispatch M12.A managed run.

## 2026-02-27 12:22:10 +00:00 - M12.A executed and closed green
- Initial run on `main` failed:
  - run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22485851113`
  - execution: `m12a_handle_closure_20260227T121637Z`
  - blocker: handles-registry file not present on `main` for dev_full path (`M12-B1`).
- Remediation applied:
  - reran same managed workflow on `migrate-dev` ref (where dev_full registry exists).
- Green closure run:
  - run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22485927170`
  - execution: `m12a_handle_closure_20260227T121911Z`
  - result: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M12.B_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_B`.
- Durable evidence:

## 2026-02-27 12:29:58 +00:00 - M12.B pre-execution plan lock
- Confirmed managed lane drift: M12 workflow had no executable `M12.B` mode.
- Patched `.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml` to add:
  - `execution_mode=m12b_execute`,
  - strict mode/subphase guard (`m12b_execute` only with subphase `B`),
  - managed `M12.B` step with fail-closed eligibility/provenance/readability checks.
- M12.B checks implemented:
  - M12.A pass and gate posture (`M12.B_READY`),
  - M11.J pass and gate posture (`M12_READY`),
  - M11.I handoff readability + run-scope parity,
  - required M11 artifact refs readability,
  - candidate bundle completeness + `CANDIDATE` status + run-scope parity + all eval-gates true.
- Blocker mapping and pass posture:
  - failures map to `M12-B2`,
  - pass emits `next_gate=M12.C_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_C`.
- Next: workflow-only commit/push and dispatch M12.B managed run.

## 2026-02-27 12:33:43 +00:00 - M12.B executed and closed green
- Workflow patch for managed M12.B lane was committed workflow-only and pushed on `migrate-dev`:
  - commit: `6db8b627f`.

- Next actionable lane is `M12.C`.

## 2026-02-27 13:00:14 +00:00 - M12.C pre-execution contract pinned
- Locked M12.C implementation contract before patching workflow.
- Decided to implement managed lane `m12c_execute` (subphase C only) with explicit upstream binding `upstream_m12b_execution`.
- Pinned fail-closed check surfaces:
  - M12.B pass posture,
  - feature/input contract compatibility via M10.G fingerprint + run-scope join_scope checks,
  - policy/degrade compatibility via M11.E + candidate compatibility gates,
  - learning-registry schema posture via handles (`SCHEMA_REGISTRY_MODE`, `GLUE_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_NAME`, `GLUE_SCHEMA_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`, `FP_BUS_LEARNING_REGISTRY_EVENTS_V1`).
- Blocker mapping for this lane is `M12-B3` only.
- Planned pass posture: `next_gate=M12.D_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_D`.

## 2026-02-27 13:04:27 +00:00 - M12.C executed and closed green

## 2026-02-27 13:20:10 +00:00 - M12.D pre-execution contract lock
- Patched `.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml` to add:
  - `execution_mode=m12d_execute`,
  - strict mode/subphase guard (`m12d_execute` only with subphase `D`),
  - `upstream_m12c_execution` input for deterministic entry binding.
- M12.D fail-closed checks implemented:
  - `M12.C` pass posture validation (`overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M12.D_READY`),
  - candidate bundle readability + `CANDIDATE` status + run-scope parity,
  - required handle closure (`MPR_PROMOTION_RECEIPT_PATH_PATTERN`, `FP_BUS_LEARNING_REGISTRY_EVENTS_V1`, schema handles),
  - run-scoped promotion receipt write + readback,
  - lifecycle payload completeness validation for `learning.registry_lifecycle.v0`,

## 2026-02-27 13:41:20 +00:00 - M12.D strict-transport repin before rerun
- User requested strict transport proof for M12.D.
- M12 plan repinned:
  - broker ACK (`topic/partition/offset`) + consumer readback hash match are now mandatory for pass.
  - prior receipt-only closure retained as historical evidence and M12.D reopened for strict rerun.
- Workflow implementation repin in progress:
  - add strict broker-proof pre-step (EKS in-cluster probe path),
  - gate M12.D pass on `m12d_broker_transport_proof.json`,
  - fail-closed `M12-B4` on any transport mismatch.
## 2026-02-27 14:01:22 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof blocker diagnosed; remediated workflow dependency
- Reviewed strict rerun artifacts from `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22489041815`.
- Root failure is not event mismatch; it is IAM denial on MSK control-plane discovery:
  - `kafka:ListClustersV2` denied for `GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction`.
- Decision made (fail-closed posture maintained):
  - keep strict broker ACK + consumer readback gate,
  - remove `ListClustersV2`/`GetBootstrapBrokers` runtime dependency from strict probe,
  - resolve bootstrap from handles (`MSK_BOOTSTRAP_BROKERS_SASL_IAM`) with optional SSM fallback (`SSM_MSK_BOOTSTRAP_BROKERS_PATH`).
- Patched `.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml` accordingly.
- Next step: rerun `M12.D` strict lane and close only if `m12d_broker_transport_proof.json.overall_pass=true` with valid topic/partition/offset + readback hash match.
## 2026-02-27 14:10:00 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof remediation v2 applied
- Second strict rerun (`22489292279`) failed at EKS kubeconfig path (`CalledProcessError`), after previous MSK control-plane dependency was removed.
- Executed control-plane remediation (AWS account):
  - added `eks:DescribeCluster` statement (`M12dEKSDescribeCluster`) to inline policy `GitHubActionsM6FRemoteDevFull` on role `GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction`;
  - created EKS access entry for the same role on cluster `fraud-platform-dev-full`;
  - associated `arn:aws:eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy` (cluster scope).
- Patched `.github/workflows/dev_full_m12_managed.yml` to avoid private-cluster pull failures:
  - probe job uses pinned private ECR digest image,
  - removed runtime `pip install` from probe container.
- Next step: push workflow patch and rerun strict M12.D; closure remains fail-closed on broker ACK/readback proof artifact.
## 2026-02-27 14:13:53 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof remediation v3 (SSM decrypt fix)
- Rerun `22489556959` showed strict probe reached job execution but failed with `EXCEPTION:UnicodeError`.
- Artifact root cause: bootstrap endpoint came from secure SSM ciphertext (`AQICA...`) due `WithDecryption=False`.
- Patched workflow:
  - SSM bootstrap fetch now uses `WithDecryption=True`.
  - Added bootstrap format guard (`:` required) to fail fast on invalid endpoint payload.
- Next step: commit workflow-only patch and rerun strict M12.D for gate closure.
## 2026-02-27 14:20:10 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof remediation v4 (Kafka data-plane IAM)
- Strict probe in run `22489708065` reached Kafka but failed on metadata timeout.
- Applied IAM remediation on OIDC role `GitHubAction-AssumeRoleWithAction`:
  - added inline policy statement `M12dKafkaDataPlaneProof` with Kafka data-plane actions (`Connect/DescribeTopic/ReadData/WriteData/AlterGroup/DescribeGroup/CreateTopic`).
- Readback confirms statement materialized.
- Next: rerun strict M12.D; if timeout remains, escalate as topic readiness/network route blocker rather than credential blocker.
## 2026-02-27 14:34:46 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof remediation v5 (confluent client swap)
- Verified in-cluster network path to MSK bootstrap (`DNS + TCP connect true`) while strict probe still timed out on metadata.
- Patched `dev_full_m12_managed.yml` strict probe implementation:
  - switched from `kafka-python` probe to `confluent-kafka` producer/consumer path,
  - preserved strict pass contract (ACK + readback hash match + exact offset).
- Next: push workflow-only patch and rerun strict M12.D.
## 2026-02-27 14:47:45 +00:00 - M12.D strict proof remediation v6 (topic readiness)
- In-cluster metadata probe confirmed active MSK cluster had `topic_count=0` before remediation.
- Created `fp.bus.learning.registry.events.v1` (3 partitions) via in-cluster admin pod using MSK IAM token path.
- Creation receipt: `created=["fp.bus.learning.registry.events.v1"]`, no errors.
- Next: rerun strict M12.D against ready topic surface.
## 2026-02-27 14:51:00 +00:00 - M12.D strict rerun closed green
- Authoritative run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22490894460`.
- Execution: `m12d_promotion_commit_20260227T144832Z`.
- Result: `overall_pass=true`, `blocker_count=0`, `next_gate=M12.E_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_E`.
- Strict proof artifact confirms broker ACK + consumer readback match:
  - topic `fp.bus.learning.registry.events.v1`, partition `0`, offset `0`, payload-hash match `true`.
- Updated M12 deep/main build plans to mark strict M12.D closure and advance next action to M12.E.

## 2026-02-27 16:53:11 +00:00 - M12.E pre-execution contract lock
- Locked M12.E execution contract before workflow patching.
- Pinned entry requirement: strict M12.D pass (`next_gate=M12.E_READY`) from durable run-control evidence.
- Pinned handle closure for lane: `MPR_PROMOTION_RECEIPT_PATH_PATTERN`, `MPR_ROLLBACK_DRILL_PATH_PATTERN`, `MF_CANDIDATE_BUNDLE_PATH_PATTERN`.
- Selected non-destructive bounded-restore rollback drill posture:
  - verify promoted candidate/ref integrity,
  - verify rollback pointers/readability,
  - verify deterministic readback/hash stability for rollback-critical artifacts,
  - publish run-scoped rollback drill report and require readback success.
- Planned lane outputs:
  - `m12e_rollback_drill_snapshot.json`,
  - `m12e_blocker_register.json`,
  - `m12e_execution_summary.json`,
  - run-scoped `learning/mpr/rollback_drill_report.json`.
- Planned pass gate: `next_gate=M12.F_READY`, `verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_F`.

## 2026-02-27 16:58:04 +00:00 - M12.E workflow lane materialized
- Added m12e_execute mode to dev_full_m12_managed with subphase guard E.
- Added deterministic upstream input upstream_m12d_execution.
- Added fail-closed rollback drill execution logic with M12-B5 blocker family and run-scoped MPR rollback report publication/readback.
- Added run-control outputs for M12.E: snapshot, blocker register, and execution summary.

## 2026-02-27 17:02:20 +00:00 - M12.E executed and closed green
- Run: `https://github.com/EsosaOrumwese/fraud-detection-system/actions/runs/22495589600`

- M12-B5 closed; next actionable lane is M12.F.

## 2026-02-27 17:06:12 +00:00 - M12 DoD checkboxes made explicit
- Updated docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/dev_full/platform.M12.build_plan.md.
- Converted each M12 subphase DoD section (A..J) from narrative numbering to checkbox items.
- Set A-E DoD items to checked and F-J DoD items to unchecked for direct visual auditability.

## 2026-02-27 17:10:40 +00:00 - M12.F pre-execution contract pinned
- Locked M12.F to upstream M12.E pass (`m12e_rollback_drill_20260227T165747Z`) with fail-closed entry checks.
- Pinned M12.F checks:
  - deterministic one-active-per-scope resolution,
  - runtime compatibility against serving/schema/topic handles,
  - post-promotion observation artifact emission.
- Pinned blocker family for this lane: M12-B6 only.
- Pinned expected pass gate: next_gate=M12.G_READY, verdict=ADVANCE_TO_M12_G.
