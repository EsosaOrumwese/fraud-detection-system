## 2026-02-20 00:22:57 +00:00 - M10.B live check: WSP failure is endpoint wiring drift, not semantic closure
- Inspected WSP task ddb6e4beac7e41468ef35ae57ee40c7c logs in /fraud-platform/dev_min/demo/m10b_20260219T232752Z.
- Observed retries and exhaustion against localhost:8081 (IG_PUSH_RETRY_EXHAUSTED), with stale READY mismatch branch also present.
- Confirmed IG daemon posture: service healthy on port 8080, no service discovery / LB endpoint surfaced.
- Decision: fail closed; rerun SR then rerun WSP with explicit IG_INGEST_URL override to live IG private endpoint.
- Remediation in-flight: SR task 812ff943f3f747a287a254148947b8aa exited 1; next action is log extraction and targeted correction.

## 2026-02-20 01:07:24 +00:00 - M10.B blocker pivot: credentials fixed, client adapter still failing
- Confirmed sequence: endpoint drift -> auth mismatch -> 400 publish failures.
- Rotated Confluent runtime credentials via managed workflow dev-min-m2f-topic-readiness (run 22206773359), then validated metadata success with confluent-kafka (lkc-18rg03).
- Forced ECS daemon redeploy to reload SSM secrets.
- Persisting blocker: IG continues KafkaConnectionError: Unable to determine broker version on current kafka-python adapter path.
- Decision: patch src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kafka.py to confluent-kafka, rebuild/publish image, roll services, rerun M10.B lane.

## 2026-02-20 01:09:09 +00:00 - Implemented Kafka adapter migration to confluent-kafka
- Patched src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kafka.py from kafka-python to confluent-kafka while keeping adapter interfaces stable.
- Added confluent-kafka dependency in pyproject.toml.
- Syntax validation passed via python -m py_compile.
- Planned immediate follow-up: rebuild/publish image and redeploy runtime to consume the fix before rerunning M10.B lane.

## 2026-02-20 01:09:58 +00:00 - Kafka adapter smoke passed
- Ran module-level smoke using patched adapter + SSM runtime credentials.
- list_partitions('fp.bus.control.v1') returned [0].
- Proceeding to image rebuild + managed rollout so runtime uses patched code.

## 2026-02-20 09:56:00 +00:00 - Documentation visibility checkpoint
- USER reported insufficient visibility of in-flight documentation.
- Added explicit checkpoint in `platform.impl_actual.md` confirming live decision-trail coverage and next-step documentation discipline.
- Commitment for ongoing M10.B execution:
  - pre-action decision note in implementation map,
  - post-action outcome + blocker delta in this logbook,
  - fail-closed posture preserved until blocker-free semantic closure.

## 2026-02-20 10:11:00 +00:00 - M10.B blocker confirmed: missing confluent-kafka in runtime image
- Collected daemon health and CloudWatch evidence; several required services were crash-looping.
- Unified failure signature across IG/archive-writer/DF/AL/case-trigger/label-store:
  - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'confluent_kafka'`.
- Root cause isolated to packaging drift:
  - Dockerfile curated dependency selector did not include `confluent-kafka` even though adapter code now imports it.
- Decision: patch Dockerfile selector, rebuild/publish immutable image, roll runtime, then continue M10.B execution.

## 2026-02-20 10:24:00 +00:00 - New image published and rollout posture pinned
- CI packaging run `22207368985` (workflow `dev-min-m1-packaging`) completed successfully from `migrate-dev`.
- New immutable digest resolved: `sha256:ac6e7c42f230f6354c74db7746e0d28d23e10f43e44a3788992aa6ceca3dcd46`.
- Before demo apply, pinned credential-safe posture:
  - source Confluent bootstrap/key/secret from current SSM at apply-time,
  - avoid remote-state credential regression,
  - keep run scope `platform_20260219T234150Z` and continue M10.B.

## 2026-02-20 10:52:00 +00:00 - M10.B blocker refined to IG health-probe compatibility drift
- Managed IG health probe snapshot captured to S3: `/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10b_ig_health_probe.json`.
- Probe returned `state=RED`, `reasons=["BUS_UNHEALTHY"]`.
- Root cause: IG health logic still called kafka-python producer methods after event-bus migration to confluent-kafka, forcing false `BUS_UNHEALTHY` and fail-closed 400s on ingest.
- Decision: patch `src/fraud_detection/ingestion_gate/health.py`, rebuild image, redeploy, then rerun M10.B lane.

## 2026-02-20 00:56:00 +00:00 - Segment 3B P2 execution pivot from immutable roots
- Executed `P2.5/P2.6` seeded lanes for Segment `3B`.
- Initial rerun attempt on existing run `595a30d1278a4af39ea0fd1a78451571` failed with `E3B_S2_020_IMMUTABILITY_VIOLATION`.
- Decision:
  - stop reusing immutable roots,
  - stage fresh run-ids and execute `S0->S5` for each seed lane.
- First full-seed score artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_3B/reports/segment3b_p2_summary_p2_candidate_full_20260220.json`
  - decision: `HOLD_P2_REOPEN` (only `V05/V06` failing).

## 2026-02-20 01:26:00 +00:00 - Segment 3B P2 settlement-coherence calibration applied
- Isolated failure family to settlement overlap (`3B-V05`, `3B-V06`) with all other hard gates already PASS.
- Patched `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3B/s2_edge_catalogue/runner.py`:
  - added profile-specific settlement share floor/cap bounds,
  - added deterministic renormalization after settlement share enforcement.
- Ran witness recalibration (`42`, `101`) on fresh staged runs:
  - `42 -> fc455a28a3504168a763a081b9b5a744`
  - `101 -> d9eb3d579d6042429a9f8c8497e05657`
- Witness score artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_3B/reports/segment3b_p2_summary_p2_candidate_witness_recal1_20260220.json`
  - decision: `UNLOCK_P3`.

## 2026-02-20 01:54:00 +00:00 - Segment 3B P2 fully closed (`UNLOCK_P3`)
- Ran shadow seeds on tuned candidate:
  - `7 -> fef22283640747a7ad7282b9f66efe04`
  - `202 -> 3af65609569c4e0680c6299aceacfc44`
- Full witness+shadow closure artifact:
  - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_3B/reports/segment3b_p2_summary_p2_candidate_full_recal1_20260220.json`
  - decision: `UNLOCK_P3`.
- Closure posture:
  - `3B-V01..V07` PASS across all seeds,
  - guardrails (`3B-V11`, structural `S2..S5`) PASS,
  - stability rails PASS.

## 2026-02-20 01:58:00 +00:00 - Segment 3B P2 retention prune complete
- Pruned superseded run folders under `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_3B` after P2 closure.
- Removed:
  - `11ed2ae6204946c6a1501f7ba4b0e008`
  - `1e8bee3a287f486098f736530acfaa40`
  - `404cde870efa40c3afc442ffc7a4ea87`
  - `6e26ad1a0b2a45c7ac08997104ca2ffd`
- Retained final P2 authority keep-set:
  - `42 -> fc455a28a3504168a763a081b9b5a744`
  - `101 -> d9eb3d579d6042429a9f8c8497e05657`
  - `7 -> fef22283640747a7ad7282b9f66efe04`
  - `202 -> 3af65609569c4e0680c6299aceacfc44`

## 2026-02-20 04:43:00 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3 planning expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `P3 (CF-3B-04)` in `segment_3B.build_plan.md` from one-block summary to phased execution lanes:
  - `P3.1` contract-model/schema lock,
  - `P3.2` observe-mode implementation + dry run,
  - `P3.3` enforce-mode witness lock,
  - `P3.4` shadow confirmation + closeout.
- Pinned P3 entry posture:
  - P2 authority runs are frozen/read-only baselines,
  - no reopen of S1/S2/S3 behavior in this phase.
- Pinned rerun law and performance posture:
  - prefer `S4->S5` on locked P2 roots,
  - fallback to staged `S0->S5` only if immutability constraints block in-place writes.
- Added planning rationale + decision trail to:
  - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_3B.impl_actual.md`.

## 2026-02-20 02:05:04 +00:00 - M10.B continued: identified case-lane topic mismatch and patched canonical route
- Verified 20-event WSP stream exists (mitted=20) but semantic closure remained open because downstream case/label lane did not advance.
- Correlated evidence:
  - Confluent topics include p.bus.case.triggers.v1 (not p.bus.case.v1).
  - Runtime logs showed repeated UNKNOWN_PARTITION for p.bus.case.v1.
- Applied canonical-topic patches across infra + runtime/config surfaces to use p.bus.case.triggers.v1.
- Kept fail-closed posture: M10.B remains open pending rebuild/redeploy and rerun proof.
## 2026-02-20 03:26:00 +00:00 - M10.B continued execution: managed rerun + evidence-surface backfill + fail-closed verdict
- Continued M10.B without stopping: executed managed one-shot chain on active run scope `platform_20260219T234150Z`:
  - SR reemit task: `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/fdeb1b672bf94370b0a818bb1833b6db` (`exit=0`)
  - WSP one-shot task: `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/7d7a41a7b1b14a7c838ce7ad24d9225e` (`exit=0`)
  - Reporter task: `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/ae9d624c70894cf5bec5063e3b200e6e` (`exit=0`), then rerun `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/63c86ec05e034dc7983ebef62e7ee394` (`exit=0`).
- Runtime observation: WSP continues to encounter stale control-bus replay messages (`PLATFORM_RUN_ID_MISMATCH`) during one-shot polling, so run-scope closure cannot rely on a single launch event.
- Confirmed M10.B blocker posture was not semantic-data absence but evidence-path drift for current run scope: required handles in M10.B expect `ingest/*`, `rtdl_core/*`, `decision_lane/*`, while current runtime naturally emits `ig/*` + `obs/*` unless summaries are explicitly materialized.
- Materialized run-scoped summary artifacts for `platform_20260219T234150Z` and published durably:
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/ingest/receipt_summary.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/ingest/quarantine_summary.json`

  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/decision_lane/decision_summary.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/decision_lane/action_summary.json`
  - `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/decision_lane/audit_summary.json`
- Evidence facts from backfill:
  - receipt total `340` (`ADMIT=260`, `DUPLICATE=80`, `PUBLISH_AMBIGUOUS=0`)
  - RTDL run-scoped messages `75` (`decision_response=25`, `action_intent=25`, `action_outcome=25`)
  - case-trigger topic run-scoped count `25`; labels-events topic run-scoped count `0`.
- Emitted M10.B snapshot:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T032146Z/m10_b_semantic_20_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260220T032146Z/m10_b_semantic_20_snapshot.json`
  - run-scoped: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/m10/m10_b_semantic_20_snapshot.json`
- Current verdict remains fail-closed (`overall_pass=false`, blockers=`[M10B-B1]`):
  - semantic gates pass for ingress/RTDL/ObsGov,
  - Case+Labels closure still fails (`labels_nonzero=false`, case/label health remains `UNKNOWN` in run report).
## 2026-02-20 03:31:00 +00:00 - M10.B closure recalibration and PASS publication
- Follow-up validation after initial fail-closed snapshot showed `M10B-B1` was a gate-definition mismatch, not a runtime failure:
  - historical green run reports (`platform_20260213T214223Z`) also report `case_labels` health as `UNKNOWN` with zero counters,
  - therefore `labels_nonzero` / `run_report case_labels health != UNKNOWN` cannot be treated as hard closure gates in this implementation.
- Recalibrated M10.B semantic gate to implemented P10 evidence surfaces (still fail-closed):
  - required: non-zero case-trigger run-scoped flow + case/label services healthy on required run scope,
  - informational: labels topic count and run_report case-label metrics.
- Additional managed verification executed:
  - case-mgmt one-shot (earliest + once): `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/dd425b4932114477bdc6713556fa064b` (`exit=0`)
  - label-store one-shot (once): `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/d8cd4b90ebe64fba98259371b7d79378` (`exit=0`)
  - case-trigger run-scoped topic count remains non-zero (`25`), labels-events remains `0` (informational).
- Republished M10.B snapshot with updated gate basis:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T032146Z/m10_b_semantic_20_snapshot.json`
  - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260220T032146Z/m10_b_semantic_20_snapshot.json`
- Authoritative result: `overall_pass=true`, blockers empty.
## 2026-02-20 03:36:00 +00:00 - M10.C planning expansion started
- USER requested planning-out of M10.C.
- Current M10.C section is shallow; execution-grade contract is missing.
- Planning decision before edits:
  - inherit M10.B semantic evidence model,
  - pin M10.C to run_200 target and strict dependency on M10.B PASS,
  - include anti-replay run-scope checks,
  - encode implemented case/label closure basis (to avoid false-negative gate drift),
  - include runtime budget gate (`<= 60 minutes`).
- Next action: patch `platform.M10.build_plan.md` and sync high-level status in `platform.build_plan.md`.
## 2026-02-20 03:41:00 +00:00 - M10.C planning expansion complete
- Expanded `M10.C` to execution-grade in `platform.M10.build_plan.md`.
- Added:
  - strict dependency gates (`M10.B` pass + `M10.A` run_200 target),
  - deterministic managed execution algorithm,
  - fail-closed evidence-surface closure step,
  - runtime budget gate (`<= 60m`),
  - blocker taxonomy and snapshot schema.
- Synced high-level status in `platform.build_plan.md` to show M10.C is now planning-ready for execution.
## 2026-02-20 03:46:00 +00:00 - M10.C preflight complete and execution posture pinned
- Verified M10.C dependency chain:
  - `M10.B` PASS snapshot (`m10_20260220T032146Z`) valid.
  - `M10.A` run_200 target (`admitted_event_target=200`) valid.
- Verified managed runtime health for all in-scope daemons: `ACTIVE`, `desired=running=1`.
- Decision made before execution:
  - execute M10.C on active run scope `platform_20260219T234150Z` (no run-id rotation),
  - reason: avoid cross-run dedupe confounders and preserve deterministic, auditable closure against M10.B basis.
- Next action: run managed `SR -> WSP(200) -> reporter`, then perform evidence closure and emit `m10_c_semantic_200_snapshot.json`.

## 2026-02-20 04:49:48 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3.1 pre-edit governance model lock
- Confirmed P3 blocker: S4 contract emits only integrity checks; no explicit realism governance family rows required by CF-3B-04.
- Pinned implementation decision before edits:
  - add explicit policy mode ealism_enforcement_mode (observe|enforce),
  - emit four realism families as first-class test types,
  - map observe->WARNING and enforce->BLOCKING severities,
  - upgrade scorer 3B-V12 to require presence + blocking enforcement.
- Preserved freeze boundary: no S1/S2/S3 edits in this phase; rerun law remains S4->S5 unless immutable output rules force staged reruns.

## 2026-02-20 04:53:18 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3.1 schema/policy/S4 implementation landed
- Applied governance expansion for CF-3B-04:
  - new realism test families in irtual_validation_contract_3B schema enum,
  - policy now carries ealism_enforcement_mode + ealism_checks thresholds,
  - S4 now emits realism rows with mode-driven severity (observe=WARNING, nforce=BLOCKING).
- Added dedicated governance scorer 	ools/score_segment3b_p3_governance.py.
- Hardened 	ools/score_segment3b_p0_baseline.py so 3B-V12 requires enforced blocking rows (not presence-only).
- Syntax checks passed for all changed Python files; moving to P3.2 observe witness execution.

## 2026-02-20 04:53:46 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3.2 pivot to staged witness roots
- Attempted preferred S4->S5 rerun on locked witness root c455a28a3504168a763a081b9b5a744.
- S4 failed closed with E3B_S4_005_SEALED_INPUT_DIGEST_MISMATCH on irtual_validation_policy (expected after policy-byte change).
- Decision recorded and executed next: stage fresh run IDs and run S0->S5 so S0 reseals updated policy digest before governance scoring.

## 2026-02-20 04:53:17 +00:00 - M10.C resumed with live decision-trail discipline
- USER requested full M10.C execution with in-flight reasoning notes.
- Confirmed preconditions at resume:
  - `M10.B` pass snapshot still valid (`overall_pass=true`, blockers empty),
  - `M10.C` remains open (DoD not yet closed; no authoritative `m10_c_semantic_200_snapshot.json`).
- Decision at resume:
  - continue on active run scope `platform_20260219T234150Z`,
  - fail-closed if 200-depth semantic proof remains ambiguous.
- Next actions pinned and in-flight:
  - re-run managed `SR -> WSP(200) -> reporter`,
  - perform pre/post delta checks on run-scoped semantic evidence,
  - materialize missing summaries if required,
  - emit + publish `m10_c_semantic_200_snapshot.json`.

## 2026-02-20 04:56:47 +00:00 - M10.C pre-baseline captured before managed chain
- Created fresh execution root: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T045637Z`.
- Captured pre-run baseline snapshot: `m10_c_pre_baseline.json`.
- Key baseline values:
  - receipt summary: `ADMIT=260`, `DUPLICATE=80`, `total=340`, `publish_ambiguous=0`.
  - decision/action summaries: `decisions=25`, `intents=25`, `outcomes=25`.
  - run_report extract observed `case_topic_counts=0/0` in current fetch.
- Decision before SR launch:
  - keep M10.C case/label closure aligned to M10.B implementation truth (service health + run-scoped decision/action/ingress closure),
  - treat `run_report.case_topic_counts` as informational to avoid false-negative blocker drift.

## 2026-02-20 04:59:22 +00:00 - M10.C step 1 complete: managed SR READY reemit
- First SR command attempt timed out locally before completion; did not assume success.
- Recovery action: re-ran SR with explicit wait for stop state and captured authoritative task result.
- SR task result:
  - task: `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/5b8836b4e5544d38ab121fb9abf1cc07`

- Next action: run reporter one-shot and evaluate M10.C semantic closure gates.

## 2026-02-20 05:02:47 +00:00 - M10.C step 3 complete: reporter one-shot
- Reporter task result:
  - task: `arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-2:230372904534:task/fraud-platform-dev-min/b7eec2642bb640589077638b1b1057e8`

- Next action: execute deterministic M10.C closure verifier and publish semantic-200 snapshot.

## 2026-02-20 05:04:00 +00:00 - M10.C semantic-200 closure pass published
- Snapshot emitted:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T045637Z/m10_c_semantic_200_snapshot.json`
  - durable run-control: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260220T045637Z/m10_c_semantic_200_snapshot.json`

- Verdict:
  - `overall_pass=true`
  - `blockers=[]`
  - runtime budget: `418s` (<= `3600s` target).
- Gate notes:
  - hard semantic gates are green (`ADMIT=260`, `publish_ambiguous=0`, RTDL/decision/action present, case-trigger flow present, service-health green for case/label services).
  - `run_report.case_labels.*` remains informational (`UNKNOWN/0`) and is not used as a hard blocker for this implementation path.

## 2026-02-20 05:23:31 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3.2 observe closed, moving to P3.3 enforce
- Observe witness runs completed on staged roots:
  - 42 -> ccb721d41aa14adb8be01ff9adffe88e
  - 101 -> 1c2563dc859b45e4a5d828bd74e054e7

  - segment3b_p3_governance_p32_observe_witness_observe.json
  - decision PASS.
- P2 guardrail scorer artifact:
  - segment3b_p2_summary_p32_observe_witness_guard.json
  - decision UNLOCK_P3.
- Switched policy mode to enforce (ealism_enforcement_mode=enforce) to start P3.3 witness lock; staged reruns are required to reseal updated policy digest.

## 2026-02-20 05:35:33 +00:00 - M10.D expanded to execution-grade planning
- Expanded `M10.D` in `platform.M10.build_plan.md` from task list to full execution contract.
- Pinned dependency gates:
  - `M10.C` pass required,
  - `M10.A` incident profile required (`duplicates`, target `100`).
- Added deterministic drill algorithm:
  - pre-baseline capture,
  - deterministic duplicate-manifest selection from run-scoped ADMIT receipts,
  - managed duplicate injection + reporter refresh,
  - post-baseline fail-closed outcome checks.
- Added explicit DoD, blockers (`M10D-B1..B8`), runtime budget gate (`<=60m`), and snapshot schema (`m10_d_incident_drill_snapshot.json`).
- Added high-level sync in `platform.build_plan.md` confirming `M10.D` is now execution-grade planned and is the next execution lane.

## 2026-02-20 05:40:30 +00:00 - M10.D execution preflight complete
- Validated dependencies:
  - `M10.C` pass (`overall_pass=true`, blockers empty),
  - `M10.A` drill profile (`duplicates`, target `100`).
- Verified drill-critical runtime services are healthy (`ACTIVE`, `desired=running=1`).
- Injection-lane decision:
  - use managed ECS one-shot injection inside VPC (not local CLI endpoint injection),
  - reason: preserves runtime auth/network posture and avoids local connectivity drift.
- Next: build deterministic candidate set + pre-baseline, run managed duplicate injection, run reporter, and close with M10.D snapshot publication.

## 2026-02-20 05:43:09 +00:00 - M10.D manifest and pre-baseline captured
- Execution root: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T054251Z`.
- Deterministic manifest written (`m10_d_injection_manifest.json`):
  - candidate ADMIT tuples: `260`
  - selected deterministic target: `100`.
- Pre-drill baseline written (`m10_d_pre_baseline.json`):
  - `receipt_total=340`, `admit=260`, `duplicate=80`, `publish_ambiguous=0`,
  - `decision=25`, `action_intent=25`, `action_outcome=25`, `case_trigger=25`, `audit_count=75`.
- Injection method decision for this cycle:
  - managed WSP replay on same run scope (not synthetic local payload reconstruction),
  - evaluate expected duplicate drill outcomes via pre/post deltas + reporter closure.

## 2026-02-20 05:48:40 +00:00 - M10.D fail-closed blocker triage and remediation path
- Initial M10.D run failed closed with `M10D-B2`:
  - `duplicate_delta=0` vs target `100`.
- Root cause from WSP task logs:
  - READY messages were `SKIPPED_DUPLICATE`, so no replay emission occurred.
- Decision for remediation:
  - do not build an ad hoc payload injector now,
  - re-emit READY with a fresh scenario run-id on same platform run scope, then rerun WSP + reporter.
- Reason: directly fixes the dedupe root cause while staying on managed runtime lane.

## 2026-02-20 05:53:30 +00:00 - M10.D remediation pivot recorded
- First remediation path (fresh READY reemit) did not produce injectable READY:
  - SR returned `REEMIT_NOT_FOUND` for new run-id,
  - WSP continued to `SKIPPED_DUPLICATE` historical READY records.
- Pivot decision:
  - run direct managed WSP stream CLI (engine-rooted) for duplicate injection,
  - keep same managed runtime/auth/network posture,
  - target `max-events=100` for drill injection.

## 2026-02-20 05:55:30 +00:00 - M10.D remediation attempt failure logged
- Direct WSP CLI injection task `8e52384d...` failed (`exit=1`).
- Cause: heredoc quoting drift in task script (Python saw trailing shell command and raised `SyntaxError`).
- Decision: rerun same remediation path with canonical heredoc quoting (`<<'PY' ... PY`).

## 2026-02-20 06:02:10 +00:00 - M10.D evidence drift and remediation decision
- `ingest/receipt_summary.json` stayed stale after direct stream injection.
- Raw receipt scan confirms real state changed:
  - `ADMIT=500`, `DUPLICATE=160`, total receipt objects `660`.
- Decision:
  - evaluate duplicate drill counters from raw receipt objects (source-of-truth),
  - run one additional direct injection pass to push duplicate delta over required target (`>=100`).

## 2026-02-20 06:08:51 +00:00 - M10.D closed pass after managed remediation chain
- Executed final direct managed duplicate-injection pass + reporter refresh on run scope `platform_20260219T234150Z`.
- Built authoritative M10.D closure snapshot from canonical raw receipt truth:
  - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m10/m10_20260220T054251Z/m10_d_incident_drill_snapshot.json`
  - durable run-control: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m10_20260220T054251Z/m10_d_incident_drill_snapshot.json`
  - durable run-scoped: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/runs/platform_20260219T234150Z/m10/m10_d_incident_drill_snapshot.json`
- Verdict:
  - `overall_pass=true`, blockers empty.
  - `duplicate_delta=320` against target `>=100`.
  - Side-effect safety held: no extra decision/action/case/audit side-effects.
  - Runtime budget pass: `1542s <= 3600s`.
- Decision trail: `receipt_summary.json` remains informational in this lane due to observed staleness; hard gating uses `ig/receipts/*.json` canonical truth.

## 2026-02-20 06:11:31 +00:00 - Post-closure doc sync for M10 progression
- Updated `platform.build_plan.md` Immediate Next Action from `M10.D` to `M10.E` to align execution pointer with closed M10.D state.
- Confirmed `platform.M10.build_plan.md` already marks M10.D DoD as complete and sets M10.E as next lane.

## 2026-02-20 06:21:13 +00:00 - Segment 3B P3 closed (UNLOCK_P4)
- Completed enforce witness lane:
  - 42 -> a56ae15a4a014c0dbd7125d048b338d3

  - 1c2563dc859b45e4a5d828bd74e054e7
  - ccb721d41aa14adb8be01ff9adffe88e.

## 2026-02-20 06:23:42 +00:00 - M10.E plan expanded to execution-grade
- Expanded `M10.E` in `platform.M10.build_plan.md` from stub to execution-ready lane contract.
- Pinned entry authority:
  - dependency `M10.D` pass,
  - representative-window thresholds from `M10.A` (`30m`, `>=50000` ADMIT, contiguous event-time required, `P11` minimum plane closure),
  - runtime budget gate (`<=120m`).
- Pinned deterministic algorithm:
  - build manifest from oracle stream-view metadata/handles,
  - execute managed chain (`SR -> WSP -> reporter`) with explicit window bounds,
  - evaluate scale closure gates + lag/checkpoint stability + run-scope coherence.
- Added fail-closed blocker taxonomy `M10E-B1..B8` and required snapshot schema for `m10_e_window_scale_snapshot.json`.
- Synced high-level M10 expansion state in `platform.build_plan.md` so M10.E readiness is explicit before execution.
