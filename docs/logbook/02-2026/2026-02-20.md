## 2026-02-20 00:22:57 +00:00 - M10.B live check: WSP failure is endpoint wiring drift, not semantic closure
- Inspected WSP task ddb6e4beac7e41468ef35ae57ee40c7c logs in /fraud-platform/dev_min/demo/m10b_20260219T232752Z.
- Observed retries and exhaustion against localhost:8081 (IG_PUSH_RETRY_EXHAUSTED), with stale READY mismatch branch also present.
- Confirmed IG daemon posture: service healthy on port 8080, no service discovery / LB endpoint surfaced.
- Decision: fail closed; rerun SR then rerun WSP with explicit IG_INGEST_URL override to live IG private endpoint.
- Remediation in-flight: SR task 812ff943f3f747a287a254148947b8aa exited 1; next action is log extraction and targeted correction.

## 2026-02-20 01:07:24 +00:00 - M10.B blocker pivot: credentials fixed, client adapter still failing
- Confirmed sequence: endpoint drift -> auth mismatch -> 400 publish failures.
- Rotated Confluent runtime credentials via managed workflow dev-min-m2f-topic-readiness (run 22206773359), then validated metadata success with confluent-kafka (lkc-18rg03).
- Forced ECS daemon redeploy to reload SSM secrets.
- Persisting blocker: IG continues KafkaConnectionError: Unable to determine broker version on current kafka-python adapter path.
- Decision: patch src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kafka.py to confluent-kafka, rebuild/publish image, roll services, rerun M10.B lane.

## 2026-02-20 01:09:09 +00:00 - Implemented Kafka adapter migration to confluent-kafka
- Patched src/fraud_detection/event_bus/kafka.py from kafka-python to confluent-kafka while keeping adapter interfaces stable.
- Added confluent-kafka dependency in pyproject.toml.
- Syntax validation passed via python -m py_compile.
- Planned immediate follow-up: rebuild/publish image and redeploy runtime to consume the fix before rerunning M10.B lane.

## 2026-02-20 01:09:58 +00:00 - Kafka adapter smoke passed
- Ran module-level smoke using patched adapter + SSM runtime credentials.
- list_partitions('fp.bus.control.v1') returned [0].
- Proceeding to image rebuild + managed rollout so runtime uses patched code.
