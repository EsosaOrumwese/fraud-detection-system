* 10:55AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AM to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures M4 activation readiness challenge and the decision to require closure-grade, lane-complete deep planning (`M4.A->M4.J`) before runtime execution to prevent under-specified phase drift.

* 10:56AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AN to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures build-driver authority ambiguity (`github_actions` vs `local_cli`) and closure hardening via explicit authority hierarchy plus pre-build-go CI realization/gate sequencing controls.

* 10:57AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AO to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures exit/handoff ordering ambiguity and the sequencing law that pins `M1.I` closure strictly after CI realization (`M1.G`) and CI gate validation (`M1.H`).

* 10:57AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AP to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures migration posture correction from implicit UI/manual-first setup to explicit IaC-first execution, with non-IaC-required capabilities treated as fail-closed blockers rather than hidden manual steps.

* 11:18AM
  - Closed Segment `1B` `P4.R1` runtime sweep with strict target met.
  - Sweep evidence (same envelope run-id `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6`):
    - attempt A (`countries_max=32`, `cache_max_bytes=1500000000`) -> `29.02%` wall improvement,
    - attempt B (`countries_max=48`, `cache_max_bytes=2500000000`) -> `30.10%` wall improvement (selected rail).
  - Artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_sweep_attempt_A_32_1500000000.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_sweep_attempt_B_48_2500000000.json`

* 11:19AM
  - Executed Segment `1B` `P4.R2` wave-1 (`max 2` candidates) using upstream 1A run-ids:
    - `416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8` -> freeze guard `PASS` (promoted),
    - `59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee` -> freeze guard `FAIL` (blocked, missing `s3_integerised_counts`).
  - Guard artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_freeze_guard_416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_freeze_guard_59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee.json`
  - Wave summary/promoted list artifact:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r2_wave1_guard_summary.json`

* 11:20AM
  - Hardened freeze-veto tooling to always emit a machine `FAIL` artifact on scorer exceptions so rejected upstream candidates are auditable, not silent.
  - File updated:
    - `tools/score_segment1a_freeze_guard.py`
  - Verification:
    - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment1a_freeze_guard.py` passed.

* 11:38AM
  - Implemented Segment `1B` `P4.R3` proxy scorer lane.
  - Added tool:
    - `tools/score_segment1b_p4r3_proxy.py`
  - Added make invocation:
    - `segment1b-p4r3-proxy` in `makefile`
  - Scorer computes S4 proxy metrics (`country_gini_s4`, `top1/top5/top10_share_s4`, `nonzero_country_count_s4`) for each `P4.R2` promoted candidate and applies fail-fast competitiveness gates.

* 11:39AM
  - Executed `P4.R3` wave-1 proxy screen:
    - `make segment1b-p4r3-proxy RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B`
  - Artifacts emitted:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r3_proxy_wave_1.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r3_proxy_416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8.json`
  - Wave-1 shortlist result:
    - shortlisted 1A candidate: `416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8`
    - mapped 1B run for next lane: `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6`
    - dropped candidates: `0`

* 11:42AM
  - Hardened `P4.R3` proxy summary-check semantics in `tools/score_segment1b_p4r3_proxy.py`.
  - `non_competitive_filtered_before_expensive_runs` now validates that all `proxy_competitive=false` candidates are present in dropped list (no trivial always-true condition).
  - Re-ran `segment1b-p4r3-proxy` to refresh wave artifact with corrected checks.

* 11:37AM
  - Added source-scan watermark block to:
    - `docs/references/project_challenge_inventory.md`
  - Inserted marker-managed section:
    - `<!-- SCAN_WATERMARKS_START --> ... <!-- SCAN_WATERMARKS_END -->`
  - Section now records, for every implementation-note path referenced in inventory:
    - latest source `Entry` timestamp observed in that doc,
    - inventory scan timestamp (`Last scanned for inventory`).

* 11:50AM
  - Opened Segment `1B` `P4.R4` execution plan in implementation notes.
  - Baseline pinned: shortlisted run `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6` fails only `top_country_no_collapse` (MC/BM flagged) while geometry/parity rails are green.
  - Next action pinned: one bounded S6-policy-only retune on fresh run-id with `S6->S9` rerun and explicit feasibility verdict.
* 12:03PM
  - Expanded `M4.A` planning to execution-grade closure criteria in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added explicit required-handle closure set for P2 (run-scope, ECS/network/logging, daemon service IDs, substrate dependencies).
  - Pinned fail-closed conditions for `M4.A`:
    - no wildcard handle references,
    - `unresolved_handle_count == 0` before M4.B,
    - blocker `M4A-B4` for ambiguous handle keys.
  - Added expected `m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot` fields so evidence is deterministic and auditable.
* 12:04PM
  - Aligned M4 obs_gov service-map wording to remove conditional daemon ambiguity:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
      - `obs_gov` mapping now pins `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE` without "if daemonized" qualifier.
  - Harmonized handles registry wording to prevent cross-doc drift:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
      - `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE` now marked as required daemon in P2; reporter remains P11 task.
* 12:05PM
  - Clarified remaining generic obs_gov wording in M4 deep plan to explicit runtime scope:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
      - replaced "daemonized parts only" with "environment conformance daemon only; reporter remains P11 task".
      - launch choreography now explicitly references obs_gov environment conformance daemon.
* 12:11PM
  - Executed `M4.A` (authority + handle closure) and published canonical snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T121004Z/m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T121004Z/m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - Result:
    - `overall_pass=true`
    - `unresolved_handle_count=0`
    - blockers: none (`M4A-B1..B4` not triggered)
  - Updated plan status:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md`: M4.A DoD + M4.A completion checkbox set to complete
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M4 sub-phase progress marks M4.A complete
* 12:12PM
  - Main platform plan immediate-next-action updated post M4.A execution:
    - now points to `M4.B` with M4.A closure snapshot anchor `m4_20260214T121004Z`.
* 12:17PM
  - Expanded `M4.B` planning to execution-grade closure in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - explicit entry conditions tied to `M4.A` pass snapshot `m4_20260214T121004Z`,
    - required input set (`M4.A` closure + P2 pack contract + required `SVC_*` handles),
    - canonical mapping + singleton + exclusions tasks,
    - stronger DoD and blocker taxonomy (`M4B-B4`, `M4B-B5`).
  - No runtime operations executed (planning-only pass).

* 12:19PM
  - Executed Segment `1B` `P4.R4` bounded S6 lane on fresh candidate run `c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b` (shortlist authority from `P4.R3`).
  - Storage-safe bootstrap used minimal-copy + junctions for heavy immutable assets (`tile_bounds`, `tile_index`, `tile_weights`) to limit run-folder growth.

* 12:20PM
  - `P4.R4` attempt A1 (`policy_version=2026-02-14-p4r4-a1`) failed in `S6` with `F4:E613_RESAMPLE_EXHAUSTED` (resample exhaustion).
  - Switched to bounded profile attempt A2 (`policy_version=2026-02-14-p4r4-a2`) and reran `S6->S9`.

* 12:21PM
  - Resolved bootstrapped-run RNG evidence gap for `S9` by importing required `S5` RNG evidence (site_tile_assign events + S5 trace rows) into candidate run with run-id normalization.
  - Archived failed validation bundle and reran `S9`; final `S9` decision is `PASS` for run `c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b`.

* 12:22PM
  - Scored `P4.R4` candidate and emitted artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4_integrated_c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p3_candidate_c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r4_attempt_c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r4_support_ceiling_c4c642c02c5b43ff97dff224bbad145b.json`
  - Outcome: collapse sentinel still flagged (`MC`, `BM`), NN tail worsened; candidate rejected and lane marked fail-closed.

* 12:23PM
  - Reverted `config/layer1/1B/policy/policy.s6.jitter.yaml` to locked posture (`policy_version=2026-02-13-r4`) after unsuccessful `P4.R4` tuning attempts.


* 12:39PM
  - Started Cluster 01 interview-prep Round 1 response drafting for recruiter-verification workflow.
  - Added Question 1 defense answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Added auditable evidence anchors for Question 1 to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/evidence.round1.md.
  - Authority/evidence sources used: docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt, docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md, docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md.
* 12:40PM
  - Executed `M4.B` (service/pack map + singleton contract).
  - Published artifact:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T121004Z/m4_b_service_map_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T121004Z/m4_b_service_map_snapshot.json`
  - Result:
    - `overall_pass=true`
    - blockers: none (`M4B-B1..B5` not triggered)
  - Updated planning status:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md`: M4.B DoD + completion checkbox set complete
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M4.B progress complete; immediate next action points to `M4.C`

* 12:46PM
  - Segment `1B` remediation sequence lock updated after `P4.R4` fail-closed review.
  - Added explicit upstream-first execution order to `segment_1B.build_plan.md`:
    1) `1A P1/S2` home-support/count candidate,
    2) `1A` freeze-veto `PASS`,
    3) `1B` proxy (`S4`) directional screen,
    4) then `1B S6->S9` + integrated scorer.
  - Added contradiction refinement note to `segment_1B.impl_actual.md` with root-cause correction.
  - Diagnostic pin: collapse countries (`MC`, `BM`) in `1A` authority lineage are home-only (`home_country_iso == legal_country_iso`), so reopen priority is upstream home-count/support shaping.


* 12:44PM
  - Updated Cluster 01 Round 1 posture per USER direction: definition-only response for Q1.
  - Removed Q1 evidence reference from docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Cleared detailed evidence anchors from docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/evidence.round1.md and left a definition-only note.


* 12:46PM
  - Rewrote Cluster 01 Round 1 Q1 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md to recruiter-proof gate language.
  - Tightening applied: replaced adjective wording with phase-gate closure semantics, pinned canonical state-machine phases (P0->P11 with closure focus on P7->P11), and added Condition/Evidence-hook lines per in-scope lane.
  - Kept evidence file untouched per definition-first workflow; Q1 now carries inline evidence hooks only.


* 1:01PM
  - Applied Q1 tightening edits in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md based on recruiter-proof review.
  - Added explicit in-scope Decision Lane (DL/DF/AL/DLA), pinned exact 20/200 bounded gate semantics (WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT), and clarified dual evidence roots (local runs path vs durable S3-compatible path).
  - Added explicit fail-closed blocker language (PUBLISH_AMBIGUOUS + P11 conformance/governance closure).


* 1:03PM
  - Updated Cluster 01 Round 1 Q1 readability in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md by adding a reader-safe term legend.
  - Added inline definitions for lifecycle phase IDs (P0..P11), run identity (platform_run_id), core component acronyms (IG/WSP/EB/RTDL/IEG/OFP/CSFB/DL/DF/AL/DLA/CM/LS), and fail-closed term PUBLISH_AMBIGUOUS.
* 01:09PM
  - Expanded `M4.C` planning to execution-grade closure in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - explicit entry conditions from `M4.B` pass artifact,
    - required IAM input surface (registry role handles + runtime dependency handles),
    - service-role matrix and boundary-rule checks,
    - explicit fail-closed blockers `M4C-B4` and `M4C-B5`.
  - Noted and pinned as blocker class: missing explicit role mapping for mapped services (e.g., `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE`) must fail closed, no implicit defaults.
  - No runtime commands executed (planning-only pass).
* 01:12PM
  - Pinned `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE` role mapping to close M4.C ambiguity:
    - introduced `ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE` in handles registry,
    - aligned runbook IAM appendix with `ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE (P2)` role boundary,
    - updated M4.C mapping from generic placeholder to explicit `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE -> ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE`.
  - Result: blocker class `M4C-B4` is now concretely testable (missing `ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE` mapping is explicit fail condition).
* 01:20PM
  - Executed `M4.C` IAM validation and published snapshot:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T121004Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T121004Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed hold (`overall_pass=false`).
  - Active blockers:
    - `M4C-B4` unmaterialized service role handles (`ROLE_IG_SERVICE`, `ROLE_RTDL_CORE`, `ROLE_DECISION_LANE`, `ROLE_CASE_LABELS`, `ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE`)
    - `M4C-B1` mapped services missing valid role bindings
    - `M4C-B2` dependency access posture unverified due unmaterialized lane roles
  - Plan alignment updates:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md` unresolved blocker register now includes active `M4C-B1/B2/B4` with closure criteria
    - `platform.build_plan.md` immediate-next-action now requires blocker resolution + M4.C re-run before M4.D.
* 01:41PM
  - Materialized lane IAM roles via Terraform demo stack and re-ran M4.C to PASS.
  - New concrete lane roles now present:
    - raud-platform-dev-min-ig-service
    - raud-platform-dev-min-rtdl-core
    - raud-platform-dev-min-decision-lane
    - raud-platform-dev-min-case-labels
    - raud-platform-dev-min-env-conformance
  - Materialization evidence:
    - uns/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T133434Z/m4_c_demo_outputs_after_apply.json
    - uns/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T133434Z/m4_c_lane_role_policy_surface.json
  - M4.C PASS evidence:
    - local: uns/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T121004Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json
    - durable: s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T121004Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json
  - Cleared blockers: M4C-B1, M4C-B2, M4C-B4.
  - Next active lane updated to M4.D.
* 01:46PM
  - Re-verified concrete lane role materialization from live Terraform state:
    - `role_ig_service_name`, `role_rtdl_core_name`, `role_decision_lane_name`, `role_case_labels_name`, `role_env_conformance_name`.
  - Re-checked all five lane roles in AWS IAM; all exist and retain ECS task trust posture.
  - Re-ran `M4.C` and published fresh PASS evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T134520Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T134520Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json`
  - Result: `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, all 13 service-role bindings valid, boundary checks PASS, dependency posture `VERIFIED_OR_READY_FOR_VERIFY`.
* 02:03PM
  - Expanded `M4.D` planning to execution-grade closure in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - explicit entry conditions tied to `M4.C` PASS + `M4.B` immutable service scope + `M3` run-scope context,
    - required-handle surface for ECS/VPC/subnets/SG/SSM/S3/RDS/CloudWatch,
    - managed-compute reachability probe requirement (no laptop-only proof),
    - deterministic dependency matrix + artifact publication contract for `m4_d_dependency_snapshot.json`,
    - expanded fail-closed blockers `M4D-B1..B5`.
  - Updated high-level phase narrative in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - No runtime execution was performed; this was planning-only as requested.
* 02:04PM
  - Tightened `M4.D` planning to close probe-lane ambiguity (anti-cram closure):
    - pinned `ecs_probe_task_definition_arn` as an explicit required input,
    - pinned one-shot ECS probe task launch as the managed-compute reachability mechanism,
    - added DoD requirement for probe-launch anchor + probe exit-status evidence,
    - added fail-closed blocker `M4D-B6` for missing/unresolvable probe task definition.
* 02:16PM
  - Executed `M4.D` network/dependency reachability validation with managed-compute probe lane.
  - Published `M4.D` evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T141438Z/m4_d_dependency_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T141438Z/m4_d_dependency_snapshot.json`
  - Execution details:
    - control-plane checks passed (VPC/subnets/SG posture, SSM readability, S3 head checks + evidence-cycle put/get/delete, DB DNS, CloudWatch log group),
    - managed ECS probe task passed (`exit_code=0`) with all expected endpoint checks (`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP`, `DB_ENDPOINT`, `S3_*`, `CLOUDWATCH_LOGS`, `SSM_ENDPOINT`).
  - Fail-closed status:
    - `overall_pass=false` with blocker `M4D-B5` only.
    - blocker cause: `SECURITY_GROUP_ID_DB` missing in canonical `M4.A` handle closure artifact surface; Terraform fallback existed but canonical closure remained incomplete.
  - Plan alignment:
    - updated `platform.M4.build_plan.md` unresolved blocker register with active `M4D-B5` + closure criteria,
    - updated `platform.build_plan.md` immediate next action to resolve `M4D-B5` then re-run `M4.D`.
* 02:25PM
  - Closed `M4D-B5` by refreshing canonical `M4.A` handle closure:
    - added `SECURITY_GROUP_ID_DB` to `required_handle_keys` and handle map.
    - refreshed `M4.A` evidence:
      - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T142309Z/m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
      - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T142309Z/m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot.json`
  - Re-ran `M4.D` against refreshed `M4.A` and achieved PASS:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T142421Z/m4_d_dependency_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T142421Z/m4_d_dependency_snapshot.json`
    - result: `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `missing_handles_in_m4a_closure=[]`.
  - Managed ECS probe lane remained green on rerun:
    - probe task exit code `0`,
    - all expected endpoint checks PASS (`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP`, `DB_ENDPOINT`, `S3_*`, `CLOUDWATCH_LOGS`, `SSM_ENDPOINT`).
  - Plan updates:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md`: `M4.D` marked complete, unresolved blockers cleared, `M4D-B5` moved to resolved.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: M4 progress marks `M4.D` complete; next action updated to `M4.E`.
* 02:36PM
  - Expanded `M4.E` planning to execution-grade closure in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - explicit entry conditions tied to `M4.D` PASS + `M3` run/image-provenance anchors,
    - required input surfaces (`M3`, `M4.A/B/C/D`, run-scope handles, dependency handles),
    - deterministic launch-contract matrix requirement (all 13 mapped services),
    - launch-profile completeness requirement (no implicit runtime-mode defaults),
    - role-binding drift checks against `M4.C`,
    - immutable image-provenance requirement (`image_digest` present),
    - non-secret artifact validation contract for `m4_e_launch_contract_snapshot.json`.
  - Expanded `M4.E` blocker taxonomy with:
    - `M4E-B5` unresolved service launch profile,
    - `M4E-B6` incomplete/non-immutable image provenance,
    - `M4E-B7` role-binding drift vs `M4.C`.
  - Updated high-level plan:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` now reflects `M4.E` execution-grade planning and next-action dependency on both `M4.D` and `M3` anchors.
  - No runtime commands executed; planning-only by request.
* 02:40PM
  - Executed `M4.E` launch-contract + run-scope injection validation.
  - Published canonical execution evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T144014Z/m4_e_launch_contract_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T144014Z/m4_e_launch_contract_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed HOLD (`overall_pass=false`) with active blocker `M4E-B5`.
  - `M4E-B5` details:
    - unresolved launch profiles for:
      - `SVC_CASE_TRIGGER`
      - `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE`
    - cause: missing pinned entrypoint handles/profiles in current authority/registry surface.
  - Validation posture from the same snapshot:
    - run-scope invariant PASS,
    - role-binding drift vs `M4.C` PASS,
    - image-provenance immutable check PASS,
    - non-secret artifact check PASS.
  - Plan updates:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md` unresolved blocker register updated with active `M4E-B5` + closure criteria.
    - `platform.build_plan.md` immediate next action updated to close `M4E-B5` then rerun `M4.E`.
* 02:45PM
  - Closed `M4E-B5` via authority pin + rerun:
    - pinned in registry:
      - `ENTRYPOINT_CASE_TRIGGER_WORKER`
      - `ENTRYPOINT_ENV_CONFORMANCE_WORKER`
    - file: `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
  - Re-ran `M4.E` and published PASS evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T144419Z/m4_e_launch_contract_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T144419Z/m4_e_launch_contract_snapshot.json`
  - Result: `overall_pass=true`, `blockers=[]`, `unresolved_launch_profiles=[]`.
  - Validation posture remained green:
    - run-scope invariant PASS,
    - role-binding drift check PASS,
    - immutable image-provenance check PASS,
    - non-secret artifact check PASS.
  - Plan updates:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md`: `M4.E` DoD + completion checkbox marked complete; unresolved blocker register cleared; `M4E-B5` moved to resolved.
    - `platform.build_plan.md`: sub-phase progress marks `M4.E` complete; immediate next action now points to `M4.F`.
* 02:59PM
  - Expanded `M4.F` planning to execution-grade closure in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added:
    - explicit entry conditions bound to `M4.E` PASS and immutable `M4.B` service scope,
    - required input surfaces from `M4.B/C/D/E` plus runtime handles,
    - pack-ordered bring-up choreography,
    - explicit stabilization predicates (`desired=1`, `running=1`, `pending=0`),
    - explicit run-scope mismatch validation (log/status scan),
    - explicit crashloop fail-closed checks,
    - deterministic `m4_f_daemon_start_snapshot.json` artifact contract.
  - Expanded blocker taxonomy with:
    - `M4F-B5` run-scope mismatch evidence,
    - `M4F-B6` launch-contract/service-set drift at bring-up.
  - Updated high-level active plan:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md` now states `M4.F` execution should include pack-ordered rollout and run-scope/crashloop validation.
  - No runtime commands executed; planning-only by request.
* 03:05PM
  - Executed `M4.F` daemon bring-up + stabilization.
  - Published execution evidence:
    - local: `runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T150452Z/m4_f_daemon_start_snapshot.json`
    - durable: `s3://fraud-platform-dev-min-evidence/evidence/dev_min/run_control/m4_20260214T150452Z/m4_f_daemon_start_snapshot.json`
  - Result: fail-closed HOLD (`overall_pass=false`) with active blockers:
    - `M4F-B1` service start/update failures,
    - `M4F-B2` singleton stabilization failure,
    - `M4F-B5` run-scope validation not provable,
    - `M4F-B6` launch-contract/service-set not materialized in ECS.
  - Root finding:
    - all `13` mapped daemon services are missing in ECS cluster (only `fraud-platform-dev-min-runtime-probe` exists),
    - bring-up attempts failed for each mapped service with `service not found in ECS cluster`.
  - Plan updates:
    - `platform.M4.build_plan.md` unresolved blocker register updated with `M4F-B1/B2/B5/B6` + closure criteria.
    - `platform.build_plan.md` immediate next action now requires daemon service/task-definition materialization and M4.F rerun.

  - Completed Cluster 01 Round-1 recruiter-defense answers (Q2..Q10) in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q set covered: bounded acceptance semantics (20/200), gold-run anchor, concrete evidence surfaces, gate enforcement mechanics, failed-gate incident/remediation, drift-sentinel case/label onboarding incident, authority hierarchy, stop/log/repin protocol, and meta-layer closure semantics.
  - Evidence grounding sourced from local-parity and dev-substrate implementation maps plus Spine Green phase/checklist authorities (no speculative claims added).


* 2:06PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q2 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md in recruiter-defense style.

* 2:07PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q3 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Pinned gold-run anchor as platform_20260212T085637Z with local and durable evidence roots and explicit rationale for why this run is used as recruiter-defense proof.


* 2:07PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q4 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q4 now provides run-specific lifecycle evidence inventory for platform_20260212T085637Z across run pin, daemons-ready, oracle-ready, ingest commit, RTDL closure, decision-chain closure, case/label closure, and obs/gov closure artifacts.


* 2:08PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q5 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q5 now explains practical gate enforcement via execution controls, evidence controls, and fail-closed controls, with explicit responses to recruiter sub-questions (non-zero failure behavior, checklist progression blocking, and distributed run-truth artifacts).


* 2:09PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q6 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q6 now documents one concrete failed-gate incident (P9 DECISION_CHAIN_COMMITTED failure on platform_20260212T075128Z), fail-closed response, remediation mechanics (DLA/AL intake hardening), and closure proof on rerun (platform_20260212T085637Z).


* 2:10PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q7 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q7 now captures the drift-sentinel Case/Label daemonization gap as a skeptical-proof story: material contradiction, detection point, fail-closed pause, run/operate onboarding changes, and closure proof before full-platform bounded validation continued.


* 2:10PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q8 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q8 now states explicit authority-conflict resolution order (Spine Green acceptance authority -> core platform-wide authority -> component authority) and operational handling when ambiguity remains (stop/escalate, no improvisation).


* 2:11PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q9 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q9 now defines the concrete stop/log/repin protocol: trigger conditions, immediate actions, override authority boundary, required audit trail, and repin/resume semantics.


* 2:11PM
  - Added Cluster 01 Round-1 Q10 answer to docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q10 now defines meta-layer closure as Run/Operate + Obs/Gov simultaneous closure, states proof surfaces, and explains concrete failure consequences if skipped.

  - Applied external review micro-fixes to Cluster 01 Q1 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Updated acronym definition: DL now explicitly Degrade Ladder.
  - Added explicit baseline-vs-full-parity line (learning_jobs OFS+MF included only in full parity; excluded from Spine Green v0 baseline).
  - Refined evidence-root wording: s3://fraud-platform/... now described as object-store root with substrate-specific backend (MinIO in local parity, AWS S3 in dev_min).


* 2:18PM
  - Applied C1.Q2 review hardening in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Added explicit knob semantics (WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=20 then 200), explicit required-output_id cap-pass rule (with intended zero-case allowance), and wording cleanup (nvelope/handle validation, ounded + repeatable readiness gates).


* 2:21PM
  - Upgraded Cluster 01 Q3 anchor answer to GOLD posture in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Added explicit environment (local_parity) and concrete anchor set (nchors=[...]) including run pin, obs closeout artifacts, IG receipts prefix, one concrete receipt object, and governance append path.


* 2:28PM
  - Applied Q4 tightening updates in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md per recruiter review.
  - Added explicit P5/P6 proof surfaces (WSP ready-consumer log + run-level stream start/stop cap markers in platform.log).
  - Resolved SR path placeholder semantics by pinning <run_id> as scenario_run_id (d17b1049bbce9df478c22ba1740e9ea) and expanded SR artifact examples with concrete IDs.
  - Added one concrete pack ID example (local_parity_control_ingress_v0) for operate path defensibility.


* 2:33PM
  - Upgraded Cluster 01 Q5 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md per strict recruiter review.
  - Added concrete procedural enforcement anchor for P7, two explicit fail-closed system behaviors (publish ambiguity blocker, oracle stream-sort conflict blocker), one named non-zero gate command used as readiness blocker (make platform-operate-parity-status), and a crisp distributed-truth design statement.


* 2:39PM
  - Tightened Cluster 01 Q5 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md to close final review holes.
  - Added explicit ambiguity-zero artifact/field anchor (obs/platform_run_report.json -> ingress.publish_ambiguous == 0, companion ingress.quarantine == 0).
  - Clarified make platform-operate-parity-status scope truthfully as a historical full-parity overreach for Spine baseline that was later corrected to Spine-safe status commands; retained it as documented non-zero blocker/drift evidence.


* 2:44PM
  - Upgraded Cluster 01 Q6 to close certification holes in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Added failing-run roots, exact DLA failure artifact paths, explicit recovery reset level (L2 fresh platform_run_id), preserved-evidence statement, success-run artifact paths, and bounded-cap parity note (same emitted=200 condition across fail/recovery runs).

* 2:46PM
  - Tightened Cluster 01 Q6 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md to keep only directly defensible claims.
  - Reframed remediation mechanics using explicit runtime rules (DLA/AL first-read `start_position=trim_horizon` when checkpoint is absent and run pin is required) and removed non-essential narrative phrasing.
  - Preserved concrete closure anchors: failing run `platform_20260212T075128Z`, recovery run `platform_20260212T085637Z`, DLA health/reconciliation artifacts, and same Gate-200 cap parity in `platform.log`.

* 3:00PM
  - Performed pre-review hardening pass on Cluster 01 Q7-Q10 in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Q7 upgraded from narrative-only to run-anchored defense using concrete pack status + case/label health metrics + platform report metrics for anchor run `platform_20260212T085637Z`.
  - Q8 tightened with executable authority precedence rule and a real conflict example (full-parity status requirement vs Spine baseline gate scope).
  - Q9 strengthened with concrete stop/log/repin examples tied to real incidents (`P9` lineage unresolved and case-label daemonization drift).
  - Q10 hardened with explicit meta-layer pass signals (five-pack run/operate binding, report/conformance evidence) and clarified closure criterion as final artifact truth rather than zero transient log noise.

* 3:05PM
  - Added final Q6 certification anchors in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Pinned exact WSP Gate-200 stop-marker log paths for failing and recovery runs:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T075128Z/platform.log`
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T085637Z/platform.log`

    - `src/fraud_detection/action_layer/worker.py:348-349`

* 3:09PM
  - Applied Q7 post-review micro-tweaks in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Updated contradiction wording to align with authority posture: "Spine Green baseline under bounded 20/200 acceptance".
  - Added explicit drift detection mechanism: preflight comparison of required baseline scope (including `P10 CASE_LABELS_COMMITTED`) versus active operate packs, detecting missing daemonized `case_labels` pack.

* 3:14PM
  - Applied Q8 review precision upgrade in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Pinned each authority tier to exact artifacts (Spine acceptance files, core platform-wide authority docs, and component design-authority pattern/example).
  - Strengthened Q9 to reviewer-requested concrete loop format: project-specific triggers, explicit STOP behavior including HOLD freeze, exact audit-trail file locations, concrete repin surface updates, override semantics, and incident closed criteria.

* 3:20PM
  - Applied Q10 review micro-pin in docs/experience_lake/cluster_01_run_lifecycle/answers.round1.md.
  - Added one concrete run/operate status artifact path per in-scope pack under the meta-layer closure proof block:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/operate/local_parity_control_ingress_v0/status/last_status.json`
    - `runs/fraud-platform/operate/local_parity_rtdl_core_v0/status/last_status.json`

- Interview prep: authored Cluster 4 Round 1 Q6 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_04_datastore_hardening/answers.round1.md`.
- Q6 verification now includes four-layer closure proof: targeted regression suites (`30 passed`), strict 20->200 rerun on `platform_20260210T091951Z`, post-stream idle-hold liveness checks, and no-recurrence signature scan for the original Postgres collapse class.
## 2026-02-14 04:13PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 4 Round 1 Q7 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_04_datastore_hardening/answers.round1.md`.
- Q7 now pins anti-recurrence guardrails in two layers: runtime connector guardrails (thread-local reuse, bounded retry, commit/rollback/evict semantics) and acceptance guardrails (post-stream + idle-hold liveness gates, recurrence-signature scan, conformance artifact requirement).
* 4:02PM

- Interview prep: authored Cluster 9 Round 1 Q5 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_09_append_only_truth/answers.round1.md`.
- Q5 now defines closure as artifact bundles (not a single status flag) with explicit pass/fail interpretation for: decision chain committed, cases committed, labels committed, and audit closed.
- Anchored claims to concrete run-scoped artifacts (`obs/platform_run_report.json`, component `metrics/health/reconciliation` outputs, and governance append logs) and stated fail-closed conditions for unresolved lineage/ambiguity/anomaly blockers.
## 2026-02-14 04:30PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 9 Round 1 Q6 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_09_append_only_truth/answers.round1.md`.

- Explicitly pinned minimum causal hops (`case_id -> timeline -> links -> decision/audit lineage`, `label_assertion_id -> emission/timeline/assertion -> source_case_event -> DLA lineage`) and fail-closed rule when any hop is missing/contradictory.
## 2026-02-14 04:37PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 9 Round 1 Q10 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_09_append_only_truth/answers.round1.md`.
- Added migration defense for append-only truth with explicit split between non-negotiable semantic invariants (append-only law, writer ownership, canonical IDs/run-scope, as-of semantics, fail-closed closure blockers) and allowed substrate changes (`local_parity -> dev_min` storage/runtime/security/observability implementation changes).
- Included migration anti-drift checks for truth-law parity, writer-boundary enforcement, run-scope isolation, and audit-chain reconstructability.

## 2026-02-14 04:45PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q1 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Q1 now pins the dev platform matrix with explicit support boundary: Windows-first authoring/operator lane + local parity controls, and managed ECS runtime truth for dev_min (no laptop runtime compute).
- Added strict split of `must work` vs `nice-to-work` and tied the claim to resolved portability classes (interpreter drift, Windows YAML/probe parsing, Windows shell quoting, Windows atomic-replace lock race, packaging/migration evidence posture).
## 2026-02-14 04:46PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q2 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Selected primary portability incident as the Windows atomic-replace concurrency regression in Scenario Runner local object-store reads (ID 158) and documented why it is the strongest systems-signal for recruiter interrogation.
- Added explicit contrast with other portability incidents (Windows quoting, Windows YAML/probe parsing, interpreter drift) to justify incident prioritization for the rest of Cluster 10 defense.
## 2026-02-14 04:47PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q3 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Pinned the selected portability incident to exact component/stage/symptom: Scenario Runner local object-store read path, runtime concurrency (leader atomic replace + follower read), and transient Windows lock-window failures (`PermissionError` / occasional `FileNotFoundError`).
- Added explicit validation framing that this surfaced in SR concurrency test flow before remediation.
## 2026-02-14 04:47PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q4 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Q4 now pins the actual root cause for the selected incident: local SR filesystem atomic-replace read window on Windows plus missing transient-read tolerance (single-attempt read semantics), distinguishing it from non-root causes (schema corruption, run-id drift, S3 behavior).
- Added explicit root-cause contradiction framing (atomic-write discipline present; atomic-read tolerance missing for Windows lock timing).
## 2026-02-14 04:48PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q5 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Added remediation split for the selected portability incident: exact code fix in `src/fraud_detection/scenario_runner/storage.py` (`_read_text_with_retry`, bounded retry on transient `PermissionError`/`FileNotFoundError`), explicit statement of no packaging-surface change for this bug class, and runbook/operator posture updates.
- Preserved fail-closed framing (retry budget bounded; persistent read failure remains terminal).
## 2026-02-14 04:49PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q6 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md` with explicit repeatability proof posture.
- Executed incident-specific verification command: `python -m pytest tests/services/scenario_runner/test_scenario_runner_concurrency.py -q` -> `1 passed in 4.86s`.
- Executed broader SR suite for context: `python -m pytest tests/services/scenario_runner -q` -> `3 failed, 60 passed, 6 skipped`; failures are `_commit_ready(..., engine_run_root=...)` call-site/signature drift in non-portability tests (`test_obs_emission`, `test_security_ops`).
- Q6 now explicitly separates incident-closure proof from unrelated suite drift to keep recruiter-facing claims truthful and defensible.
## 2026-02-14 04:50PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q7 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Added explicit anti-regression guardrails for the selected portability incident: code-level bounded fail-closed retry semantics in SR local store reads, targeted concurrency regression-test guardrail, and claim-discipline guardrail requiring incident-specific evidence.
- Included explicit CI-scope caveat (no dedicated single-test CI claim in this answer set) to keep recruiter-facing assertions truthful.
## 2026-02-14 04:51PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q8 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Added explicit non-support boundaries for portability claims: no ambient system-Python pack execution, no universal shell-equivalence claim, no unbounded retry/exception swallowing for local lock races, and no laptop-runtime closure claims for dev_min.
- Framed each boundary with supported alternative posture to keep recruiter-facing claims strict and defensible.
## 2026-02-14 04:52PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q9 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Q9 now links local portability remediation to dev migration readiness: explicit runtime contracts, immutable packaging posture, launch-contract/run-scope enforcement, and managed-compute evidence gates.
- Added explicit statement that "no laptop runtime compute" moved from preference to binding acceptance rule (managed ECS execution/evidence required).
## 2026-02-14 04:52PM
- Interview prep: authored Cluster 10 Round 1 Q10 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_10_portability_packaging/answers.round1.md`.
- Added one-sentence recruiter-facing systems-thinking statement that ties portability work to contract design, fail-closed gates, and repeatable evidence beyond local-machine behavior.
## 2026-02-14 05:01PM
- Interview prep: hardened `docs/experience_lake/cluster_02_control_ingress/answers.round1.md` against recruiter review nits for Cluster 2.
- Added explicit micro-pins: `basis.ig_admission_locator` JSON path (`basis.ig_admission_locator`) and local-parity checkpoint backend pin (`wsp_checkpoint.backend=postgres` in `config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml`).
- Strengthened Q6 with a literal anchor receipt reference, explicit top-level ADMIT receipt key surface, concrete `eb_ref` key shape, and explicit schema authority path (`docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/ingestion_gate/ingestion_receipt.schema.yaml`).
- Strengthened Q8 with explicit bad-path form for the drift incident (`s3://fraud-platform/platform_20260206T042550Z/ig/receipts/<receipt_id>.json`) and clarified provenance field locations (`receipts.pins_json.platform_run_id`, `pins.platform_run_id`).
## 2026-02-14 05:06PM
- Interview prep: applied final recruiter hardening to Cluster 2 Q8 in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_02_control_ingress/answers.round1.md`.
- Added explicit historical-evidence truth boundary: wrong-prefix contradiction class retained, exact stale-run receipt filename not retained.
- Added implementation-time recording note for the 2026-02-06 IG receipt-ref run-scope mismatch entry.
- Added explicit post-fix regression guard reference: `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py::test_receipt_ref_scoped_to_envelope_run_id`.
## 2026-02-14 05:17PM
- Interview prep: hardened Cluster 3 answers in `docs/experience_lake/cluster_03_streaming_reliability/answers.round1.md` from recruiter review.
- Added concrete pins for Q1/Q7 (`session.jsonl` event/field names, ingress/report JSON paths, receipt refs path), plus explicit test-path anchors in Q5.
- Added Q2 consumer start-position map (lane-by-lane defaults, config sources, and first-read override applicability), Q3 persisted checkpoint identity proof (table/columns + real stream_id row from anchor run), and Q4/Q6 incident hardening with specific run IDs and evidence path posture.
## 2026-02-14 05:34PM
- Interview prep: hardened `docs/experience_lake/cluster_04_datastore_hardening/answers.round1.md` to close recruiter evidence gaps and move Cluster 4 from narrative-only toward artifact-pinned defense.
- Q1 pin added: explicit local-parity DSN profile anchor (`config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml`) for `IG_ADMISSION_DSN` and `WSP_CHECKPOINT_DSN`.
- Q3 pins added: failing run root (`platform_20260210T083021Z`), concrete cross-lane operate log paths, and explicit recorded failure signature (`psycopg.OperationalError ... localhost:5434 ... Address already in use (0x00002740/10048)`).
- Q5 pins added: concrete connector code anchor (`src/fraud_detection/postgres_runtime.py`, `postgres_threadlocal_connection(...)`), migrated adapter example (`src/fraud_detection/identity_entity_graph/store.py`), and transaction-side-effect trigger note (`idle in transaction`/lock-wait with blocked `ALTER TABLE admissions ...`).
- Q6 pins added: rerun run root (`platform_20260210T091951Z`), explicit five-pack status artifact list + pass fields (`running`, `readiness.ready`, active-run-id match), concrete rerun obs artifacts (`platform_run_report.json`, `environment_conformance.json`), and reproducible six-target pytest command for the `30 passed` set.
- Q7 pins added: executable guardrail locations for post-stream idle-hold closure in Phase 5.10 build-plan gate and operator runbook status command (`make platform-operate-parity-status`).
- Truth boundary retained: historical incident run artifacts are referenced by canonical paths/signatures from implementation records; no fabricated receipt IDs/log lines were introduced.
