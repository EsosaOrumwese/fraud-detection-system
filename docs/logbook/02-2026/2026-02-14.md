* 6:20AM
  - Expanded Segment `1B` remediation build authority with a detailed post-RED recovery program in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`.
  - Added new `P4.R` execution structure to handle long-runtime constraints and avoid blind full-chain reruns:
    - `P4.R1` runtime rail stabilization (`S4` performance-only),
    - `P4.R2` guarded `1A` reopen lane (freeze-guard mandatory),
    - `P4.R3` proxy-first fast-screen lane (`S2/S4`),
    - `P4.R4` collapse/geometry closure lane (`S6`),
    - `P4.R5` integrated promotion decision lane,
    - `P4.R6` storage/run-retention hard-cap lane.
  - Appended implementation decision trail entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.
* 7:47AM
  - Executed `P4.R1` runtime rail implementation for Segment `1B` `S4`.
  - Code changes:
    - `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/runner.py`
      - added runtime cache knobs:
        - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_COUNTRIES_MAX`
        - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`
      - switched cache control to bounded entry + byte-budget eviction.
      - emitted runtime cache telemetry into `s4_run_report.pat.runtime_cache`.
    - `makefile`
      - `segment1b-s4` now forwards the above env knobs.
  - Ran benchmark on same envelope run-id:
    - `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6`
    - settings:
      - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_COUNTRIES_MAX=24`
      - `ENGINE_1B_S4_CACHE_MAX_BYTES=1000000000`
  - Benchmark artifacts:
    - before:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_s4_before_e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6.json`
    - after:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_s4_after_e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6.json`
    - summary:
      - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_benchmark_e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6.json`
  - Measured movement:
    - wall-clock `6386.64s -> 4804.72s` (`24.77%` faster),
    - CPU `6478.19s -> 4767.66s`,
    - determinism hash unchanged; rows emitted unchanged.
* 10:06AM
  - Per USER request, performed a post-2026-02-11 challenge-mining pass focused on:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md
  - Created temporary staging file with section-mapped proposed additions:
    - scratch_files/project_challenge_inventory_new_challenges_temp.md
  - Inserted new inventory entries using section-local suffix IDs to avoid renumber drift:
    - Phase 2 addendum: 46-AA .. 46-AQ
    - Phase 3 spine addendum: 228-AA .. 228-AD
    - Phase 4 migration addendum: 248-AA .. 248-AM
  - Updated inventory file:
    - docs/references/project_challenge_inventory.md
  - Quick integrity checks:
    - suffix IDs added = 34,
    - duplicate suffix IDs = none.

* 10:15AM
  - Added lesson-inferred migration challenges that were previously implicit in implementation notes into:
    - docs/references/project_challenge_inventory.md
  - New entries appended under migration addendum:
    - 248-AN (build-driver authority ambiguity: github_actions vs local_cli + CI gate lock),
    - 248-AO (exit/handoff sequencing ambiguity after CI realization/gate validation),
    - 248-AP (UI/manual-first assumption corrected to IaC-first blocker posture).
  - Evidence anchors sourced from:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5808-5831
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6672-6692

* 10:21AM
  - Propagated newly added challenge-inventory addendum IDs into solution mapping:
    - docs/references/project_challenge_solution_map.md
  - Added three addendum batches with full Solution/Status/Evidence entries:
    - Batch 29: 46-AA .. 46-AQ (Data Engine post-2026-02-11 remediation addendum),
    - Batch 30: 228-AA .. 228-AD (Spine Green post-closure addendum),
    - Batch 31: 248-AA .. 248-AP (Dev-substrate migration execution addendum).
  - Updated solution-map footer mapped-range summary to include suffix-ID coverage.
  - Integrity check run:
    - all targeted suffix IDs present in both inventory and solution map,
    - no missing propagated IDs detected for this addendum set.
