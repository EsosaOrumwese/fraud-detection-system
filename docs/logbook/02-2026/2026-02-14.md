* 6:20AM
  - Expanded Segment `1B` remediation build authority with a detailed post-RED recovery program in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.build_plan.md`.

    - `P4.R2` guarded `1A` reopen lane (freeze-guard mandatory),
    - `P4.R3` proxy-first fast-screen lane (`S2/S4`),
    - `P4.R4` collapse/geometry closure lane (`S6`),
    - `P4.R5` integrated promotion decision lane,
    - `P4.R6` storage/run-retention hard-cap lane.
  - Appended implementation decision trail entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.

* 10:55AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AM to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures M4 activation readiness challenge and the decision to require closure-grade, lane-complete deep planning (`M4.A->M4.J`) before runtime execution to prevent under-specified phase drift.

* 10:56AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AN to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures build-driver authority ambiguity (`github_actions` vs `local_cli`) and closure hardening via explicit authority hierarchy plus pre-build-go CI realization/gate sequencing controls.

* 10:57AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AO to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures exit/handoff ordering ambiguity and the sequencing law that pins `M1.I` closure strictly after CI realization (`M1.G`) and CI gate validation (`M1.H`).

* 10:57AM
  - Added recruiter-facing challenge story entry for ID 248-AP to:
    - docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md
  - Story captures migration posture correction from implicit UI/manual-first setup to explicit IaC-first execution, with non-IaC-required capabilities treated as fail-closed blockers rather than hidden manual steps.

* 11:18AM
  - Closed Segment `1B` `P4.R1` runtime sweep with strict target met.
  - Sweep evidence (same envelope run-id `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6`):
    - attempt A (`countries_max=32`, `cache_max_bytes=1500000000`) -> `29.02%` wall improvement,
    - attempt B (`countries_max=48`, `cache_max_bytes=2500000000`) -> `30.10%` wall improvement (selected rail).
  - Artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_sweep_attempt_A_32_1500000000.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r1_sweep_attempt_B_48_2500000000.json`

* 11:19AM
  - Executed Segment `1B` `P4.R2` wave-1 (`max 2` candidates) using upstream 1A run-ids:
    - `416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8` -> freeze guard `PASS` (promoted),
    - `59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee` -> freeze guard `FAIL` (blocked, missing `s3_integerised_counts`).
  - Guard artifacts:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_freeze_guard_416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/reports/segment1a_freeze_guard_59cc9b7ed3a1ef84f3ce69a3511389ee.json`
  - Wave summary/promoted list artifact:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r2_wave1_guard_summary.json`

* 11:20AM
  - Hardened freeze-veto tooling to always emit a machine `FAIL` artifact on scorer exceptions so rejected upstream candidates are auditable, not silent.
  - File updated:
    - `tools/score_segment1a_freeze_guard.py`
  - Verification:
    - `python -m py_compile tools/score_segment1a_freeze_guard.py` passed.

* 11:38AM
  - Implemented Segment `1B` `P4.R3` proxy scorer lane.
  - Added tool:
    - `tools/score_segment1b_p4r3_proxy.py`
  - Added make invocation:
    - `segment1b-p4r3-proxy` in `makefile`
  - Scorer computes S4 proxy metrics (`country_gini_s4`, `top1/top5/top10_share_s4`, `nonzero_country_count_s4`) for each `P4.R2` promoted candidate and applies fail-fast competitiveness gates.

* 11:39AM
  - Executed `P4.R3` wave-1 proxy screen:
    - `make segment1b-p4r3-proxy RUNS_ROOT=runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B`
  - Artifacts emitted:
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r3_proxy_wave_1.json`
    - `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1B/reports/segment1b_p4r3_proxy_416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8.json`
  - Wave-1 shortlist result:
    - shortlisted 1A candidate: `416afa430db3f5bf87180f8514329fe8`
    - mapped 1B run for next lane: `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6`
    - dropped candidates: `0`

* 11:42AM
  - Hardened `P4.R3` proxy summary-check semantics in `tools/score_segment1b_p4r3_proxy.py`.
  - `non_competitive_filtered_before_expensive_runs` now validates that all `proxy_competitive=false` candidates are present in dropped list (no trivial always-true condition).
  - Re-ran `segment1b-p4r3-proxy` to refresh wave artifact with corrected checks.

* 11:37AM
  - Added source-scan watermark block to:
    - `docs/references/project_challenge_inventory.md`
  - Inserted marker-managed section:
    - `<!-- SCAN_WATERMARKS_START --> ... <!-- SCAN_WATERMARKS_END -->`
  - Section now records, for every implementation-note path referenced in inventory:
    - latest source `Entry` timestamp observed in that doc,
    - inventory scan timestamp (`Last scanned for inventory`).

* 11:50AM
  - Opened Segment `1B` `P4.R4` execution plan in implementation notes.
  - Baseline pinned: shortlisted run `e4d92c9cfbd3453fb6b9183ef6e3b6f6` fails only `top_country_no_collapse` (MC/BM flagged) while geometry/parity rails are green.
  - Next action pinned: one bounded S6-policy-only retune on fresh run-id with `S6->S9` rerun and explicit feasibility verdict.
* 12:03PM
  - Expanded `M4.A` planning to execution-grade closure criteria in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
  - Added explicit required-handle closure set for P2 (run-scope, ECS/network/logging, daemon service IDs, substrate dependencies).
  - Pinned fail-closed conditions for `M4.A`:
    - no wildcard handle references,
    - `unresolved_handle_count == 0` before M4.B,
    - blocker `M4A-B4` for ambiguous handle keys.
  - Added expected `m4_a_handle_closure_snapshot` fields so evidence is deterministic and auditable.
* 12:04PM
  - Aligned M4 obs_gov service-map wording to remove conditional daemon ambiguity:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
      - `obs_gov` mapping now pins `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE` without "if daemonized" qualifier.
  - Harmonized handles registry wording to prevent cross-doc drift:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_min_handles.registry.v0.md`
      - `SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE` now marked as required daemon in P2; reporter remains P11 task.
* 12:05PM
  - Clarified remaining generic obs_gov wording in M4 deep plan to explicit runtime scope:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.M4.build_plan.md`
      - replaced "daemonized parts only" with "environment conformance daemon only; reporter remains P11 task".
      - launch choreography now explicitly references obs_gov environment conformance daemon.
