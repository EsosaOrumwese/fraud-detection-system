* 05:10AM
  - Executed full 200-event parity live run and captured cross-component evidence for active run `platform_20260209T045202Z`.
  - Run orchestration proof:
    - `make platform-operate-parity-status` showed all packs/processes `running ready`, including decision lane (`dl_worker`, `df_worker`, `al_worker`, `dla_worker`).
  - Stream proof:
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260209T045202Z/event_bus/event_bus.log` contains `EB publish event_id` counts of `200` for each of:
      - `fp.bus.context.arrival_events.v1`
      - `fp.bus.context.arrival_entities.v1`
      - `fp.bus.context.flow_anchor.fraud.v1`
      - `fp.bus.traffic.fraud.v1`
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260209T045202Z/platform.log` contains four WSP stop markers, each with `emitted=200`.
  - Consolidated report proof:
    - `make platform-run-report ...` wrote `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260209T045202Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`.
    - Report key values: ingress `received=800`, `admit=800`; RTDL `inlet_seen=800`, `ieg_events_seen=800`, `ofp_events_seen=200`; `audit_append=200`.
    - Report surfaced CSFB metrics formatting issue (`basis_note`) for follow-up.
  - Component-store proof:
    - IEG metrics show `events_seen=800`.
    - DF metrics show `decisions_total=200`, all quarantine/fail-closed.
    - DLA metrics show `append_success_total=200`; sqlite confirms intake/quarantine rows present.
    - AL ledgers/outcomes remained zero in this run because no DF admits were emitted.
  - Appended detailed decision trail + interpretation to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 05:40AM
  - Appended pre-change implementation plan for RTDL fix pass to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` before code edits.
  - Fix scope recorded with evidence-backed roots and concrete closure path:
    - OFP daemon observability export missing (DL required signal artifact gap).
    - CSFB postgres observability SQL wildcard placeholder fault.
    - DF canonical envelope timestamp format mismatch (`+00:00` vs required `...Z`) causing publish quarantine.
    - DF-CSFB key derivation fallback to `event_id` causing false binding lookups.
    - DLA intake reason ordering causing noisy `UNKNOWN_EVENT_FAMILY` before run-scope enforcement.
  - Validation plan recorded: targeted tests + syntax + fresh 200-event parity rerun + artifact proof checks.
* 05:52AM
  - Applied runtime patch set for RTDL closure:
    - DF `_utc_now` canonical Z-format emission to close publish schema quarantine blocker.
    - DF `_flow_id` no longer falls back to payload `event_id`.
    - OFP projector now emits observability artifacts in daemon mode.
    - CSFB intake now emits observability artifacts in daemon mode.
    - CSFB store conflict metric SQL wildcard adjusted for postgres compatibility.
    - DLA inlet now enforces run scope before event-family classification.
  - Added/updated regression tests:
    - `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_worker_helpers.py`
    - `tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase3_intake.py` (run-scope-first case).
  - Next: run targeted tests and fresh parity 200-event validation evidence.
