* 06:29AM
  - Recorded platform-level caveat root-cause findings from RTDL runtime pass in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Pinned direct evidence and reasoning for:
    - missing `schema_version` on source traffic (harness normalization in pass),
    - IG `QUARANTINE` causes split by family:
      - DF `decision_response` -> `SCHEMA_FAIL`,
      - AL `action_outcome` -> `PINS_MISSING` with observed `event_class=traffic`.
  - Logged this as diagnostics-only documentation update (no code/config mutations in this step).

* 06:41AM
  - Normalized chronology in platform/component implementation maps (*.impl_actual.md) by sorting ## Entry: blocks by timestamp.
  - Applied byte-preserving reorder (raw bytes) so character encoding/content was not transcoded; only entry order changed.
  - Verification: no remaining timestamp order violations across implementation maps.
