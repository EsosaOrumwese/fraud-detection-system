* 06:29AM
  - Recorded platform-level caveat root-cause findings from RTDL runtime pass in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Pinned direct evidence and reasoning for:
    - missing `schema_version` on source traffic (harness normalization in pass),
    - IG `QUARANTINE` causes split by family:
      - DF `decision_response` -> `SCHEMA_FAIL`,
      - AL `action_outcome` -> `PINS_MISSING` with observed `event_class=traffic`.
  - Logged this as diagnostics-only documentation update (no code/config mutations in this step).

* 06:41AM
  - Normalized chronology in platform/component implementation maps (*.impl_actual.md) by sorting ## Entry: blocks by timestamp.
  - Applied byte-preserving reorder (raw bytes) so character encoding/content was not transcoded; only entry order changed.
  - Verification: no remaining timestamp order violations across implementation maps.


* 12:36PM
  - Started "close only actually-open RTDL drifts" change wave.
  - Locked open set before code edits:
    - WSP must always emit `schema_version` on traffic envelopes,
    - DF decision payload schema must accept emitted `source_event.origin_offset`,
    - IG must fail fast on RTDL class-map/schema-policy mismatch (prevents stale-runtime misclassification),
    - add explicit local-parity RTDL live-mode baseline for currently live-capable consumers.
  - Recorded pre-change decision entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer_producer.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md`

* 12:41PM
  - Closed open RTDL drift items in code/config and validated with targeted suites.
  - WSP:
    - enforced `schema_version=v1` at stream-view envelope construction and send-time guard.
    - files: `src/fraud_detection/world_streamer_producer/runner.py`, `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_push_retry.py` -> `6 passed`.
  - DF contract:
    - aligned decision payload schema to emitted `source_event.origin_offset`.
    - files: `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/real_time_decision_loop/decision_payload.schema.yaml`, `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase1_contracts.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase1_contracts.py tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase6_synthesis.py` -> `9 passed`.
  - IG runtime guard:
    - added fail-fast RTDL class-map/schema-policy alignment check at gate build; scoped to RTDL-configured profiles.
    - files: `src/fraud_detection/ingestion_gate/admission.py`, `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py` -> `10 passed`.
  - RTDL live-core baseline:
    - added Make targets: `platform-ieg-projector-parity-live`, `platform-rtdl-core-parity-live`.
    - updated runbook section 21 for live-core startup and scope note (`IEG/OFP/CSFB`).
    - smoke: `make platform-rtdl-core-parity-live` prints expected launch plan.

* 12:53PM
  - Started reviewer P1 closure wave for open items `7/8/9` only.
  - Recorded pre-change decision entries before code edits in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/context_store_flow_binding.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/online_feature_plane.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_log_audit.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked implementation order:
    - (8) parity Postgres defaults and fallback hardening,
    - (7) evidence vocabulary normalization,
    - (9) run_config_digest propagation on DLA lineage/query surfaces.


* 01:12PM
  - Closed reviewer P1 items `7/8/9` in code + docs + tests.
  - Item 8 (parity Postgres-default):
    - make parity targets now pass Postgres DSNs for IEG/OFP/CSFB.
    - local_parity profile includes OFP snapshot index DSN wiring.
    - CSFB now fails closed when projection locator is missing (no silent sqlite fallback).
    - runbook parity steps updated to use explicit parity DSN env vars.
  - Item 7 (evidence vocabulary):
    - DLA `recent_attempts` now includes additive `origin_offset` object while retaining legacy `source_offset*` keys.
  - Item 9 (digest consistency):
    - DLA lineage chain persists and exposes `run_config_digest` in query/runtime surfaces.
    - lineage scope guard now emits explicit `RUN_CONFIG_DIGEST_MISMATCH` on mixed-digest chains.
  - Tests executed:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/context_store_flow_binding/test_phase7_parity_integration.py -q` -> `4 passed`.
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase4_lineage.py tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase5_query.py tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase7_observability.py -q` -> `11 passed`.
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit -q` -> `36 passed`.
  - Added RTDL contract README note for v0 shared-stream projector ignore expectations and evidence vocabulary (`origin_offset` vs `source_offset`).

* 02:36PM
  - Completed contextual RTDL pre-validation read-through in AGENTS order (platform authorities, interface pack boundary, narratives, RTDL component design-authority notes, and RTDL implementation maps).
  - Confirmed active pins for upcoming validation: ContextPins discipline, canonical envelope boundary, IG trust-boundary ownership, EB replay offsets/watermarks, deterministic/idempotent semantics, explicit degrade posture, append-only + supersedes evidence posture.
  - Noted no immediate ambiguity requiring user clarification before validation start; ready to execute RTDL validation matrix next.

* 02:44PM
  - Added pre-run platform implementation-map plan for requested 200-event local-parity RTDL live-stream validation.
  - Scope locked to: SR->WSP->IG->EB runtime evidence + IEG/OFP/CSFB live-core + DF/DL/AL/DLA boundary validation suites.
  - Next action: execute parity stack/service startup, run capped stream, then collect and compare evidence against `flow-narrative-platform-design.md`.

* 02:47PM
  - Live-core startup attempt surfaced a shared Postgres SQL blocker in IEG/OFP/CSFB: unquoted `offset` identifier causes syntax errors during DDL/failure-path writes.
  - Switched to blocker remediation before continuing the 200-event validation run.
  - Recorded pre-change plan entries in platform + component implementation maps (`platform`, `identity_entity_graph`, `online_feature_plane`, `context_store_flow_binding`).

* 03:31PM
  - Closed the cross-component SQL blocker by quoting `"offset"` identifier usage in:
    - `src/fraud_detection/identity_entity_graph/migrations.py`
    - `src/fraud_detection/identity_entity_graph/store.py`
    - `src/fraud_detection/online_feature_plane/store.py`
    - `src/fraud_detection/context_store_flow_binding/migrations.py`
    - `src/fraud_detection/context_store_flow_binding/store.py`
  - Executed requested 200-event parity validation run and consolidated evidence for:
    - `platform_run_id=platform_20260208T151238Z`
    - `scenario_run_id=9bad140a881372d00895211fae6b3789`
  - Runtime evidence captured:
    - WSP stream complete `emitted=800` (200 per each output).
    - IG receipts for run/scenario: `ADMIT=800`, `QUARANTINE=0`, `DUPLICATE=0`.
    - EB scenario-filtered records:
      - `fp.bus.traffic.fraud.v1=200`
      - `fp.bus.context.arrival_events.v1=200`
      - `fp.bus.context.arrival_entities.v1=200`
      - `fp.bus.context.flow_anchor.fraud.v1=200`
    - IEG metrics: `events_seen=800`, `mutating_applied=800`, `apply_failure_count=0`.
    - CSFB state: intake dedupe `600`, join frames `250`, flow bindings `200`, apply failures `0`.
  - Decision-layer boundary suites executed:
    - `tests/services/degrade_ladder` -> `40 passed`
    - `tests/services/decision_fabric` -> `69 passed`
    - `tests/services/action_layer/test_phase8_validation_matrix.py` -> `3 passed`
    - `tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase8_validation_matrix.py` -> `4 passed`
  - Logged residual caveat:
    - OFP run-scoped metrics remain `events_seen=194` / `events_applied=194` for same run while IG/EB show `200` traffic admissions.
    - Added implementation-map note; no contract relaxation applied.

* 03:34PM
  - Ran OFP-only diagnostic to probe the 194/200 gap:
    - cleared run-scoped OFP checkpoints for `ofp.v0::platform_20260208T151238Z` and attempted explicit replay pass.
    - replay attempt hit runtime auth/env mismatch (`UnrecognizedClientException`) in that path; counts remained unchanged.
  - Recorded as diagnostic-only action in OFP implementation map; follow-up required for parity live startup/checkpoint lifecycle hardening.

* 03:37PM
  - Re-ran RTDL component suites after the SQL identifier hardening changes:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/identity_entity_graph tests/services/online_feature_plane tests/services/context_store_flow_binding -q`
    - Result: `85 passed in 31.19s`
  - Outcome: no regressions detected in IEG/OFP/CSFB after quoting `"offset"` paths.

* 03:59PM
  - Started deep-diagnosis/closure for OFP `194/200` undercount (user-requested).
  - Collected sequence-level evidence:
    - Kinesis traffic stream for run/scenario has `200` records.
    - OFP applied offsets have `194` rows.
    - Exactly the first `6` stream sequence numbers are missing from OFP applied offsets.
  - Recorded pre-change plan entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/online_feature_plane.impl_actual.md`
  - Next action locked: patch parity OFP startup default to `trim_horizon`, then reconcile run-scoped OFP state and verify `200/200`.

* 04:01PM
  - Implemented OFP parity startup hardening:
    - `makefile`: changed `OFP_EVENT_BUS_START_POSITION` default from `latest` to `trim_horizon`.
    - `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md`: added section 21 note documenting trim-horizon default + explicit latest override.
  - Reconciled the affected run by resetting only OFP run-scoped rows for stream `ofp.v0::platform_20260208T151238Z` and replaying once from trim horizon.
  - Validation evidence:
    - `ofp_run_once_processed=200`
    - `ofp_applied_events_for_run=200`
    - OFP metrics: `events_seen=200`, `events_applied=200`
    - sequence diff re-check: Kinesis traffic `200`, OFP applied `200`, missing `0`
  - Post-fix OFP suite:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/online_feature_plane -q` -> `29 passed`.

* 04:18PM
  - Verified `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md` against current repo state.
  - Mechanical check: all runbook-referenced `make` targets exist (`17/17`, no missing targets).
  - Revalidated expected suite counts used in runbook sections 16/17/19/20:
    - DL: `40 passed`
    - DF: `69 passed`
    - AL phase8 matrix: `3 passed`
    - AL full: `45 passed`
    - DLA phase8 matrix: `4 passed`
    - DLA full: `36 passed`
  - Runbook corrections applied:
    - updated as-of date to `2026-02-08`,
    - corrected DLA phase8 expected result from `3 passed` to `4 passed`,
    - removed duplicate WSP checklist line in section 14.

* 04:25PM
  - Added a consolidated full-run narrative entry to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` for:
    - `platform_run_id=platform_20260208T151238Z`
    - `scenario_run_id=9bad140a881372d00895211fae6b3789`
  - Entry includes:
    - end-to-end timeline across SR/WSP/IG/EB/IEG/OFP/CSFB,
    - run-scoped evidence counts and invariants,
    - explicit clarification of decision-layer posture:
      - `DF/DL/AL/DLA` validated in current v0 boundary via component matrices (not live daemons for this run),
      - matrix pass evidence listed (`DL/DF/AL/DLA`).
  - Also pinned that OFP undercount was closed (`200/200`) after trim-horizon default hardening + run-scoped replay.

* 04:36PM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md` to block Phase 5 until meta layers are explicitly closed.
  - Added new `Phase 4.6 — Meta-layer closure gate (Run/Operate + Obs/Gov)` with detailed DoD sections:
    - governance lifecycle facts,
    - evidence-ref resolution access audit,
    - environment auth posture (`local_parity` vs `dev/prod`),
    - platform run reconciliation reporter,
    - `service_release_id` provenance stamping,
    - downstream durable run/operate posture,
    - corridor checks + anomaly taxonomy closure,
    - environment conformance gate,
    - closure evidence/handoff criteria.
  - Updated plan status so next active platform phase is now `Phase 4.6` (blocking), not Phase 5.

* 05:54PM
  - Began platform meta-layer DoD hardening pass per user request (plan-first).
  - Re-read platform authorities and pre-design decisions in AGENTS order before edits:
    - platform blueprint + deployment tooling,
    - data-engine interface boundary,
    - platform narratives,
    - run/operate + obs/gov pre-design decisions,
    - current `platform.build_plan.md` + `platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Recorded detailed pre-change decision entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 05:55PM
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md` with objective DoD hardening for meta-layer closure.
  - Applied drift and gate corrections:
    - canonical run pins now explicit (`platform_run_id` + `scenario_run_id`; `run_id` alias only),
    - token-order update includes `scenario_run_id` + `platform_run_id`,
    - IEG semantic idempotency tuple aligned to `(platform_run_id, event_class, event_id)`,
    - OFP 4.3.H stale "pending until DF/DL exists" text closed,
    - 4.6.A split into MUST-EMIT-now vs RESERVED-until-owning-plane-active families.
  - Added new DoD sections:
    - `4.6.J` platform orchestration contract (plane-agnostic meta-layer),
    - `4.6.K` objective 4.6 quality gate and evidence criteria.
  - Logged post-change rationale/outcome in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 06:07PM
  - Began 4.6.J implementation (Run/Operate meta-layer orchestration).
  - Recorded live design decision in `platform.impl_actual.md` choosing in-repo declarative orchestrator over make-only wrappers or external Procfile-only supervision.
  - Locked initial scope to: lifecycle contract (`up/down/restart/status`), run-scope env injection, evidence/log surfaces, and plane onboarding via pack files.

* 06:12PM
  - Applied 4.6.J scaffolding artifacts:
    - new orchestrator module (`run_operate/orchestrator.py`),
    - local parity process packs (control_ingress + rtdl_core),
    - make lifecycle targets (`platform-operate-*`),
    - runbook section 3.1 for orchestrated parity mode.
  - Recorded detailed implementation rationale and contract mapping in `platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Next step locked: targeted tests + command-smoke validation before declaring 4.6.J implementation pass.

* 06:14PM
  - Ran 4.6.J targeted validation and applied two fixes:
    - fixed Windows path YAML escaping in orchestrator test pack generation (`yaml.safe_dump`),
    - fixed runtime templated probe-port parsing in orchestrator (deferred int coercion after env interpolation).
  - Validation results:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q` -> `3 passed`.
    - orchestration status command-smoke succeeded for both packs via direct CLI and make status targets.
  - Appended full issue/fix/evidence entry to `platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 06:16PM
  - Detected pre-existing non-orchestrated IG process on `127.0.0.1:8081` (pid `26788`, manual python service).
  - Logged decision to terminate stale process before 4.6.J orchestrated launch to avoid ingress ownership ambiguity.
  - Logged planned pack adjustment for configurable WSP event cap in orchestrated control_ingress run.

* 06:53PM
  - Completed pre-launch remediation for orchestrated 200-event proof run.
  - Patched control_ingress process pack to accept env-driven WSP cap (`WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT`) and pass through `--max-events-per-output`.
  - Cleared multiple stale non-orchestrated IG service listeners from port `8081`; confirmed no listener remained before orchestrated launch.
  - Logged rationale and next-step launch sequence in `platform.impl_actual.md`.

* 06:54PM
  - Diagnosed orchestrated worker crash: packs invoked system `python` lacking `psycopg`.
  - Logged and approved fix to pin per-pack interpreter via `RUN_OPERATE_PYTHON` (default `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`) while keeping orchestrator core unchanged.
* 07:07PM
  - Began run-scope hardening follow-up for 4.6.J evidence closure.
  - Logged pre-change decision entry in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md for:
    - orchestrator active-run precedence fix,
    - platform-sr-run-reuse active-run pinning,
    - clean orchestrated 200-event rerun plan + evidence collection.
* 07:45PM
  - Completed run-scope hardening and clean orchestrated parity validation closure.
  - Code fixes applied:
    - src/fraud_detection/run_operate/orchestrator.py: active run-id precedence (ACTIVE_PLATFORM_RUN_ID/RUN_OPERATE_PLATFORM_RUN_ID -> ACTIVE_RUN_ID file -> legacy PLATFORM_RUN_ID).
    - makefile: platform-sr-run-reuse now pins PLATFORM_RUN_ID from uns/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID; platform-run-new now uses PLATFORM_RUN_ID_NEW to avoid stale env reuse.
    - src/fraud_detection/world_streamer_producer/ready_consumer.py: added out-of-scope READY skip (SKIPPED_OUT_OF_SCOPE) and terminal dedupe treatment.
  - Tests:
    - python -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q -> 4 passed.
    - python -m pytest tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py -q -> 3 passed.
  - Runtime remediation:
    - diagnosed and terminated stale non-orchestrated projector shells/processes that were injecting old run-scope expectations (platform_20260208T151238Z).
    - restarted orchestrated packs and revalidated platform-operate-parity-status active run scope.
  - Final clean evidence run:
    - platform_run_id=platform_20260208T193407Z
    - scenario_run_id=24827c0356195144a6d9a847c3563347
    - WSP capped stream: 4 output stop markers with mitted=200 reason=max_events; START_AFTER_FIRST4=0.
    - IG receipts: 800 total (ADMIT=800; 200 each for traffic + 3 context outputs).
    - RTDL state checks:
      - OFP: ofp_applied_events=200.
      - CSFB: intake_dedupe=600, join_frames=250, low_bindings=200, join_apply_failures=0.
      - IEG: dedupe=800, pply_failures=0.
  - Detailed decision/evidence entry appended in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md.
* 07:52PM
  - Started next-step execution for Phase 4.6 closure support.
  - Logged pre-change plan in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md covering:
    - dedicated 4.6.A..4.6.J PASS/FAIL validation matrix artifact,
    - WSP duplicate-skip log suppression design + tests,
    - evidence/update paths for implementation-map + logbook closure.
* 07:53PM
  - Completed next-step closure tasks.
  - Added explicit Phase 4.6 matrix artifact:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md
    - includes PASS/FAIL per 4.6.A..4.6.J, evidence anchors, and Phase 5 unblock posture.
  - Linked matrix path in build plan 4.6.K:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md.
  - Implemented WSP duplicate-noise suppression:
    - src/fraud_detection/world_streamer_producer/ready_consumer.py
    - per-message duplicate log throttling (WSP_READY_DUPLICATE_LOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS, default 60s)
    - no repeated duplicate ready-record appends for already-terminal messages.
  - Updated tests:
    - 	ests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py.
  - Validation:
    - python -m pytest tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py -q -> 4 passed.
    - python -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q -> 4 passed.
  - Appended detailed outcome entry in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md.
* 07:58PM
  - Added two requested standalone entries in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md:
    - detailed latest clean run record (platform_20260208T193407Z / scenario_run_id=24827c0356195144a6d9a847c3563347),
    - separate Phase 4.6 gate-posture snapshot sourced from platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md.
* 08:03PM
  - Started closure implementation for `4.6.A` (governance lifecycle emission) and `4.6.D` (platform run reporter).
  - Completed pre-change deep design pass and appended live reasoning entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked implementation approach before coding:
    - introduce platform-wide governance writer module with idempotent append-only JSONL + marker-key semantics,
    - wire SR/WSP/IG lifecycle/anomaly emit hooks to standardized event families,
    - introduce on-demand platform run reporter artifact under run-scoped obs path with ingress + RTDL minimum counters and evidence refs.
  - Alternatives (component-local ad-hoc governance and IG-emitter overloading) were considered and rejected due to schema drift/ownership coupling risks.
  - Next action: implement modules + hooks, then add targeted tests and run validation suites.
* 08:25PM
  - Completed closure wave for `4.6.A` + `4.6.D` and finalized post-change evidence.
  - Added governance/reporter closure assertions to make required family emission objective:
    - `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py` now asserts `RUN_READY_SEEN`, `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_ENDED`, and out-of-scope `RUN_CANCELLED`.
    - `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py` now asserts `CORRIDOR_ANOMALY` (publish-ambiguous path) and `POLICY_REV_CHANGED` (policy activation).
  - Re-ran targeted validation:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/platform_governance/test_writer.py -q` -> `3 passed`
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/platform_reporter/test_run_reporter.py -q` -> `1 passed`
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py -q` -> `4 passed`
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_health_governance.py -q` -> `2 passed`
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py -q` -> `7 passed`
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q` -> `4 passed`
  - Live evidence commands executed on `platform_run_id=platform_20260208T201742Z`:
    - `make platform-run-report PLATFORM_PROFILE=config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260208T201742Z`
      - wrote `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260208T201742Z/obs/platform_run_report.json`.
    - `make platform-governance-query PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260208T201742Z GOVERNANCE_QUERY_LIMIT=500`
      - returned governance families including `RUN_READY_SEEN`, `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_ENDED`, `EVIDENCE_REF_RESOLVED`, `RUN_REPORT_GENERATED`.
  - Updated matrix artifact `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md`:
    - marked `4.6.A` PASS and `4.6.D` PASS,
    - overall 4.6 remains blocked by `4.6.B/C/E/G/H/I`.
  - Residual note carried forward: CSFB metrics placeholder-format warning still appears in reporter basis notes; treated as quality follow-up, not closure blocker for `4.6.D`.
* 08:27PM
  - Corrected stale wording in matrix row `4.6.B` (`docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md`).
  - Change: row now acknowledges `EVIDENCE_REF_RESOLVED` emission exists, while keeping `4.6.B` FAIL for the actual remaining gap (missing RBAC/allowlist-gated evidence-ref corridor and deny-path audit trail).
* 08:31PM
  - Started `4.6.B` closure implementation (evidence-ref resolution corridor + access audit).
  - Re-read obs/gov + run/operate pre-design sections for ref-resolution rules and pinned a pre-change design entry in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` before code edits.
  - Locked approach: implement RBAC/allowlist-gated in-repo corridor, wire reporter through it, add explicit allow/deny CLI surface, and update matrix with live evidence.
* 08:38PM
  - Closed `4.6.B` implementation in code:
    - added evidence-ref corridor `src/fraud_detection/platform_governance/evidence_corridor.py` (allowlist gate + run-scope check + allow/deny governance emission),
    - extended governance CLI with `resolve-ref`,
    - added make target `platform-evidence-ref-resolve`,
    - routed reporter evidence-resolution through corridor (`src/fraud_detection/platform_reporter/run_reporter.py`).
  - Added/updated tests:
    - `tests/services/platform_governance/test_evidence_corridor.py` (new),
    - `tests/services/platform_reporter/test_run_reporter.py` (corridor summary assertion).
  - Validation run results:
    - governance writer: `3 passed`
    - governance corridor: `3 passed`
    - reporter: `1 passed`
    - WSP ready consumer: `4 passed`
    - IG admission: `7 passed`
    - orchestrator: `4 passed`
  - Live parity evidence on `platform_20260208T201742Z`:
    - regenerated run report with corridor summary (`attempted=50,resolved=50,denied=0`),
    - allow probe returned `RESOLVED`,
    - deny probe returned `DENIED` with `REF_ACCESS_DENIED`,
    - governance query showed `EVIDENCE_REF_RESOLVED` + `CORRIDOR_ANOMALY` facts.
  - Updated matrix `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md`:
    - marked `4.6.B` PASS,
    - remaining blockers now `4.6.C/E/G/H/I`.
  - Note: one transient `S3_APPEND_CONFLICT` occurred when two probe commands were launched in parallel; reran sequentially and used sequential outputs as canonical evidence.
* 08:48PM
  - Started closure wave for remaining Phase 4.6 blockers: 4.6.C, 4.6.E, 4.6.G, 4.6.H, 4.6.I.
  - Appended pre-change live reasoning + implementation sequence to docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md before coding.
  - Locked approach: implement env-ladder auth context + release provenance substrate first, then corridor closure matrix checks, then executable profile-conformance artifact, then final handoff/matrix PASS update.
* 09:04PM
  - Ran targeted Phase 4.6 closure matrix (`4.6.C/E/G/H/I`) across IG + governance + reporter + conformance + WSP tests.
  - Result: `32 collected`, `29 passed`, `3 failed`.
  - All failures are in `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase5_auth_rate.py` during Flask `app.test_client()` initialization (`werkzeug.__version__` missing).
  - Logged decision in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` to apply a test-local compatibility shim (no production code change) and rerun full targeted matrix.
* 09:09PM
  - Closed Phase 4.6 remaining gates (`4.6.C/E/G/H/I`) with executable evidence and updated matrix rollup.
  - Targeted closure matrix rerun after IG test harness compatibility shim:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase5_auth_rate.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py tests/services/platform_governance/test_writer.py tests/services/platform_governance/test_evidence_corridor.py tests/services/platform_governance/test_anomaly_taxonomy.py tests/services/platform_reporter/test_run_reporter.py tests/services/platform_conformance/test_checker.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_push_retry.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py`
    - result: `32 passed`.
  - Additional corridor boundary evidence:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase6_commit_replay.py tests/services/action_layer/test_phase6_checkpoints.py tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase4_registry.py -q`
    - result: `13 passed`.
  - Environment conformance artifact:
    - `make platform-env-conformance PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260208T201742Z`
    - wrote `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260208T201742Z/obs/environment_conformance.json` (`status=PASS`).
  - Live reporter/provenance refresh:
    - `make platform-run-report PLATFORM_PROFILE=config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260208T210900Z`
    - `make platform-governance-query PLATFORM_RUN_ID=platform_20260208T210900Z GOVERNANCE_EVENT_FAMILY=RUN_REPORT_GENERATED GOVERNANCE_QUERY_LIMIT=5`
    - confirmed normalized SYSTEM actor and provenance block on governance event.
  - Live deny-path anomaly proof:
    - strict `platform-evidence-ref-resolve` probe intentionally denied with `REF_ACCESS_DENIED`; subsequent corridor anomaly query confirms `anomaly_category=REF_ACCESS_DENIED` on new event.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.phase4_6_validation_matrix.md`:
    - all rows `4.6.A..4.6.J` now PASS,
    - `4.6.K` rollup now PASS,
    - Phase 5 unblock now YES.
  - Appended full closure narrative + gate posture details in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
* 09:10PM
  - Synchronized rolling status in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md` after matrix closure:
    - Phase 4.6 marked complete,
    - next active phase moved to Phase 5.
  - Rationale logged in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` to keep planning and evidence artifacts aligned.
* 09:20PM
  - Added two requested narrative entries to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`:
    - expected flow across the four EB topics (arrival_events, arrival_entities, flow_anchor_fraud, traffic_fraud) under implemented rails,
    - expected platform flow for implemented posture distinguishing live-stream daemons vs non-daemon matrix-validated components, including orchestrator handling semantics.
  - Entry content explicitly records run/operate pack behavior, RTDL-core live scope (`IEG/OFP/CSFB`), non-live scope (`SR` as job; `DF/DL/AL/DLA` as matrix/runtime), and meta-layer command boundaries.
* 09:47PM
  - Started decision-lane daemonization closure (`DL/DF/AL/DLA`) to remove matrix-only gap and align run/operate with platform narrative.
  - Added mandatory pre-change design entry to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md` covering:
    - objective diagnosis,
    - options considered + selected path,
    - file-level implementation scope,
    - invariants and validation matrix.
  - Next execution locked:
    - implement worker entrypoints for `DL/DF/AL/DLA`,
    - wire new decision-lane pack + make targets,
    - run targeted tests and pack command-smoke,
    - append post-change evidence entries.

    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.impl_actual.md
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_log_audit.impl_actual.md
  - Locked component decisions before code edits:
    - add DL/DF/AL workers,
    - finalize DLA worker onboarding,
    - wire local-parity runtime profile + decision-lane pack + lifecycle targets,
    - preserve fail-closed and at-least-once idempotency invariants.

* 10:02PM
  - Logged pre-implementation refinement pass for decision-lane daemonization before code edits.
  - Locked implementation mechanics for `DL/DF/AL/DLA` workers, IG auth allowlist expansion for DF/AL publishers, decision-lane run-operate pack onboarding, and parity aggregate lifecycle wiring.
  - Captured detailed per-component planning entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_log_audit.impl_actual.md`
  - Captured platform-wide orchestration/mechanics lock entry in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Next concrete actions (now unblocked): implement worker modules, update profile/packs/make targets/runbook, then run targeted validation and append post-change evidence entries.
* 2026-02-08 10:14PM
  - Added pre-code execution lock entry across platform/component implementation maps for decision-lane daemonization.
  - Locked concrete worker pipelines (DL/DF/AL/DLA), checkpoint model, profile/auth wiring, and validation gates before code edits.
* 10:28PM
  - Appended mid-implementation decision-trail lock entries before additional edits in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/degrade_ladder.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/action_layer.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_log_audit.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked remaining closure sequence: decision-lane pack + make lifecycle wiring, IG/AL policy alignment, runbook posture sync, validation suites, then post-change evidence entry.
* 10:35PM
  - Completed decision-lane daemonization closure updates and evidence capture.
  - Implemented/wired:
    - new pack `config/platform/run_operate/packs/local_parity_rtdl_decision_lane.v0.yaml`,
    - make targets `platform-operate-rtdl-decision-up/down/restart/status`,
    - parity aggregate now includes decision lane,
    - AL policy action-kind alignment (`ALLOW`, `STEP_UP`, `QUEUE_REVIEW`),
    - IG local parity allowlist entries for DF/AL publishers,
    - local parity profile DL/DLA locator token wiring,
    - runbook parity posture sync to daemonized decision lane.
  - Validation executed:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q` -> 4 passed,
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/degrade_ladder -q` -> 40 passed,

    - `python -m pytest tests/services/action_layer -q` -> 45 passed,
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit -q` -> 36 passed.
  - Pack smoke:
    - first `up/status` found DF crash (`CSFB projection_db_dsn is required`),
    - patched pack defaults with IEG/OFP/CSFB DSN envs,
    - re-ran `up/status` -> all four (`dl/df/al/dla`) running ready,
    - ran `down/status` -> all stopped.
* 10:40PM
  - Added pre-change design entry for anti-drift hardening in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Locked two-layer approach before edits:
