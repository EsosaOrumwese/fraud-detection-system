### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 06:29AM
  - Recorded platform-level caveat root-cause findings from RTDL runtime pass in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Pinned direct evidence and reasoning for:
    - missing `schema_version` on source traffic (harness normalization in pass),
    - IG `QUARANTINE` causes split by family:
      - DF `decision_response` -> `SCHEMA_FAIL`,
      - AL `action_outcome` -> `PINS_MISSING` with observed `event_class=traffic`.
  - Logged this as diagnostics-only documentation update (no code/config mutations in this step).

* 06:41AM
  - Normalized chronology in platform/component implementation maps (*.impl_actual.md) by sorting ## Entry: blocks by timestamp.
  - Applied byte-preserving reorder (raw bytes) so character encoding/content was not transcoded; only entry order changed.
  - Verification: no remaining timestamp order violations across implementation maps.


* 12:36PM
  - Started "close only actually-open RTDL drifts" change wave.
  - Locked open set before code edits:
    - WSP must always emit `schema_version` on traffic envelopes,
    - DF decision payload schema must accept emitted `source_event.origin_offset`,
    - IG must fail fast on RTDL class-map/schema-policy mismatch (prevents stale-runtime misclassification),
    - add explicit local-parity RTDL live-mode baseline for currently live-capable consumers.
  - Recorded pre-change decision entries in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer_producer.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_fabric.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md`

* 12:41PM
  - Closed open RTDL drift items in code/config and validated with targeted suites.
  - WSP:
    - enforced `schema_version=v1` at stream-view envelope construction and send-time guard.
    - files: `src/fraud_detection/world_streamer_producer/runner.py`, `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_push_retry.py` -> `6 passed`.
  - DF contract:
    - aligned decision payload schema to emitted `source_event.origin_offset`.
    - files: `docs/model_spec/platform/contracts/real_time_decision_loop/decision_payload.schema.yaml`, `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase1_contracts.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase1_contracts.py tests/services/decision_fabric/test_phase6_synthesis.py` -> `9 passed`.
  - IG runtime guard:
    - added fail-fast RTDL class-map/schema-policy alignment check at gate build; scoped to RTDL-configured profiles.
    - files: `src/fraud_detection/ingestion_gate/admission.py`, `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py`.
    - tests: `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase10_df_output_onboarding.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py` -> `10 passed`.
  - RTDL live-core baseline:
    - added Make targets: `platform-ieg-projector-parity-live`, `platform-rtdl-core-parity-live`.
    - updated runbook section 21 for live-core startup and scope note (`IEG/OFP/CSFB`).
    - smoke: `make platform-rtdl-core-parity-live` prints expected launch plan.

* 12:53PM
  - Started reviewer P1 closure wave for open items `7/8/9` only.
  - Recorded pre-change decision entries before code edits in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/context_store_flow_binding.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/online_feature_plane.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/decision_log_audit.impl_actual.md`
  - Locked implementation order:
    - (8) parity Postgres defaults and fallback hardening,
    - (7) evidence vocabulary normalization,
    - (9) run_config_digest propagation on DLA lineage/query surfaces.


* 01:12PM
  - Closed reviewer P1 items `7/8/9` in code + docs + tests.
  - Item 8 (parity Postgres-default):
    - make parity targets now pass Postgres DSNs for IEG/OFP/CSFB.
    - local_parity profile includes OFP snapshot index DSN wiring.
    - CSFB now fails closed when projection locator is missing (no silent sqlite fallback).
    - runbook parity steps updated to use explicit parity DSN env vars.
  - Item 7 (evidence vocabulary):
    - DLA `recent_attempts` now includes additive `origin_offset` object while retaining legacy `source_offset*` keys.
  - Item 9 (digest consistency):
    - DLA lineage chain persists and exposes `run_config_digest` in query/runtime surfaces.
    - lineage scope guard now emits explicit `RUN_CONFIG_DIGEST_MISMATCH` on mixed-digest chains.
  - Tests executed:
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/context_store_flow_binding/test_phase7_parity_integration.py -q` -> `4 passed`.
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase4_lineage.py tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase5_query.py tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase7_observability.py -q` -> `11 passed`.
    - `python -m pytest tests/services/decision_log_audit -q` -> `36 passed`.
  - Added RTDL contract README note for v0 shared-stream projector ignore expectations and evidence vocabulary (`origin_offset` vs `source_offset`).

* 02:36PM
  - Completed contextual RTDL pre-validation read-through in AGENTS order (platform authorities, interface pack boundary, narratives, RTDL component design-authority notes, and RTDL implementation maps).
  - Confirmed active pins for upcoming validation: ContextPins discipline, canonical envelope boundary, IG trust-boundary ownership, EB replay offsets/watermarks, deterministic/idempotent semantics, explicit degrade posture, append-only + supersedes evidence posture.
  - Noted no immediate ambiguity requiring user clarification before validation start; ready to execute RTDL validation matrix next.
