### Date: 4th February 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 02:23AM
  - Added detailed answers to sections 4-6 in real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (join readiness, ordering/watermarks, state stores/rebuildability).

* 02:24AM
  - Added detailed answers to sections 7-10 in real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (Decision Fabric, Actions, Audit/Decision Log, Security/Governance).

* 02:27AM
  - Validated RTDL design assumptions against available contracts/schemas (arrival_events_5B, flow_anchor_with_fraud_6B, event_stream_with_fraud_6B) and canonical event example; noted that full-scale stream datasets are not present locally for throughput validation.

* 02:34AM
  - Struck covered questions in scratch_files/scratch.md and added partial/uncovered questions into real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (including new sections 11-17).

* 02:36AM
  - Answered RTDL open questions in sections 1-10 of real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (archive ordering/SLA, ContextPins + schema authority, join locality, commit points, decision_id, and security/auth).

* 02:38AM
  - Added detailed answers to sections 11-13 in real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (topic discovery/lifecycle, health/backpressure, config pinning).

* 02:40AM
  - Added detailed answers to sections 14-17 in real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (observability/reconciliation, failure lanes, parity hooks, idempotency).

* 02:44AM
  - Added Control & Ingress open pins and default resolutions to Phase 3 of platform.build_plan.md.

* 02:51AM
  - Applied GPT-5.2 review tightenings to real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md (deadline alignment, join locality constraints, origin vs checkpoint offsets, seed pinning, archive gating).

* 02:58AM
  - Patched real-time_decision_loop.pre-design_decision.md with FlowBinding Index rules and evidence requirements.

* 03:10AM
  - Updated flow-narrative-platform-design.md with RTDL pinned decisions (FlowBinding, deadlines, origin_offset evidence, archive truth posture, dedupe guardrails, seed pinning).

* 05:46AM
  - Tightened flow narrative wording: FlowBinding run scope, explicit missing-context modes, IG dedupe phrasing, and bus truth clarification.
