### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 4:30AM
  - Captured migration challenge raised by USER in active platform planning:
    - problem: moving from local-compute success to managed dev-substrate portability lacked an explicit cross-phase checklist.
  - Added binding section to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - `## Local-to-Managed Compute Migration Playbook (binding across phases)`.
  - Section now pins required migration mechanics:
    - local coupling inventory,
    - managed execution package contract,
    - managed-lane preflight,
    - cutover/rollback criteria,
    - portability acceptance proof (`run anywhere` evidence).
  - Tightened Phase `3.C` progression rule:
    - each component migration gate must satisfy this playbook before acceptance-valid status.
  - Related implementation-map entries appended:
    - pre-change lock + applied closure in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 4:46AM
  - Added explicit migration-solution lock requested by USER in active plan:
    - migration must start with a full decomposition of "what worked locally" (every process/subprocess), not only service-level labels.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - inserted `0. Local run process decomposition baseline (mandatory first)` inside the local-to-managed playbook,
    - required artifact: `Local Run Process Inventory Matrix`,
    - added DoD item requiring matrix completion per active corridor before acceptance progression.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`:
    - appended pre-change lock + applied closure entries.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 4:50AM
  - Created first concrete `Local Run Process Inventory Matrix` artifact for migration baseline:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/local_run_process_inventory_matrix.md`
  - Matrix now inventories local-run process depth across full parity chain plus active dev-substrate operator lane:
    - infra/bootstrap,
    - Oracle sync/pack/sort,
    - SR/WSP/IG/EB boundary,
    - RTDL core + decision,
    - case/label,
    - learning jobs,
    - obs/gov,
    - dev-substrate phase3 local operator commands.
  - Added explicit artifact-path reference in active build plan playbook section:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`
  - Process ID coverage in this pass:
    - `65` inventory rows with stable corridor-prefixed IDs.
  - Related implementation-map entry appended:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 5:29AM
  - Resumed dev_substrate migration planning and pinned migration baseline scope to **Spine Green v0**.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - added `Migration Baseline Gate (Spine Green v0)` section,
    - baseline includes C&I + RTDL + Case/Labels + Run/Operate/Obs/Gov,
    - Learning/Registry full closure (`OFS/MF/MPR`) marked out of scope for this migration phase.
  - Decision trail recorded in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md` (pre-change lock + applied entry).
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 5:45AM
  - Captured a dedicated ordered process-flow artifact for what "Spine Green runs locally" means end-to-end.
  - Added:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/local_run_spine_green_major_process_flow.md`
  - Artifact scope:
    - Spine Green v0 only (`CI`, `RTDL`, `Case/Labels`, `Run/Operate`, `Obs/Gov`),
    - Learning (`OFS/MF/MPR`) explicitly excluded.
  - Each ordered step now records:
    - process name,
    - entry point (`make` / CLI / run_operate step id),
    - one-line inputs -> outputs,
    - one green-proof artifact path/topic.
  - Decision/action trail appended in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 5:55AM
  - Opened execution track for USER-requested local parity proof of `Spine Green v0` at `200` bounded events using:
    - `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md`
  - Logged pre-run detailed plan and acceptance criteria in:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Scope lock for this run:
    - in scope: `Control+Ingress`, `RTDL`, `Case+Labels`, `Run/Operate+Obs/Gov`
    - out of scope: `Learning/Registry (OFS/MF/MPR)` migration closure
  - Next actions queued:
    - parity stack bootstrap/status,
    - oracle sync/seal/sort for `c25a2675fbfbacd952b13bb594880e92`,
    - run/operate spine packs + SR/WSP bounded `200` pass,
    - artifact/health/governance evidence closeout and drift assessment.

* 7:59AM
  - Completed full local parity execution for Spine Green v0 verification on run:
    - `platform_20260212T075128Z`
  - Runtime actions completed:
    - parity stack up/bootstrap/status,
    - oracle sync + pack + strict check,
    - stream-sort built for `s3_event_stream_with_fraud_6B`, `arrival_events_5B`, `s1_arrival_entities_6B`, `s3_flow_anchor_with_fraud_6B`,
    - run/operate packs up for `control_ingress`, `rtdl_core`, `rtdl_decision_lane`, `case_labels`, `obs_gov`,
    - SR READY publish and bounded WSP stream (`200` per output).
  - Evidence highlights:
    - WSP stop markers show all four outputs ended at `emitted=200`,
    - IG receipts count: `1581`, sampled receipts include `offset_kind=kinesis_sequence`,
    - conformance artifact status is `PASS`,
    - governance stream includes `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_READY_SEEN`, `RUN_ENDED`, `RUN_REPORT_GENERATED`.
  - Material findings (prevents strict all-green declaration):
    - `decision_log_audit` remains `AMBER` (`UNRESOLVED_AMBER`, `lineage_unresolved_total=1`),
    - `platform-operate-parity-status` fails when Learning env vars are absent (`PARITY_OFS_RUN_LEDGER_DSN`) despite Learning being out-of-scope,
    - IG `/v1/ops/health` without auth header yields `500`; authenticated request returns `GREEN`.
  - Notes appended to implementation maps:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md`

* 8:35AM
  - Opened remediation pass after USER direction to proceed with both fixes:
    - parity status env behavior for spine-only checks,
    - DLA unresolved lineage issue.
  - Added pre-change lock entry to:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Root-cause notes pinned in that entry:
    - learning pack strict env expansion caused `platform-operate-parity-status` failure when explicit OFS/MF DSNs were not present,
    - DLA unresolved chain traced to missed decision/intent ingestion with outcome present; local parity DLA kinesis start at `latest` with no checkpoint is a likely miss path for early run events.
  - Remediation plan pinned:
    - add default-safe learning DSN expansion in learning pack,
    - harden DLA intake start/skip behavior for run-scoped parity,
    - run targeted tests,
    - re-run 200-event parity verification and reassess Spine Green v0 closure.

* 9:01AM
  - Applied remediation code/config updates:
    - `config/platform/run_operate/packs/local_parity_learning_jobs.v0.yaml`
      - OFS/MF ledger DSN env expansion now fallback-safe.
    - `src/fraud_detection/decision_log_audit/intake.py`
      - `RUN_SCOPE_MISMATCH` path now checkpoint-skip without quarantine write.
      - first kinesis read with no checkpoint + required run pin forces `trim_horizon`.
    - `src/fraud_detection/action_layer/worker.py`
      - first kinesis read with no checkpoint + required run pin forces `trim_horizon`.
    - `tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase3_intake.py`
      - added run-scope skip and kinesis first-read behavior coverage.
  - Targeted tests executed:
    - `tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase3_intake.py` -> `12 passed`.
    - `tests/services/decision_log_audit/test_dla_phase4_lineage.py` -> `5 passed`.
    - `tests/services/action_layer/test_phase8_validation_matrix.py` -> `3 passed`.
  - Fresh local parity verification run executed:
    - run id: `platform_20260212T085637Z`
    - bounded stream: `WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=200`
    - WSP stop markers observed at `08:58:56`/`08:59:39`/`08:59:40` with `emitted=200` across expected outputs.
  - Closure evidence:
    - `make platform-operate-parity-status` now clean and all packs ready.
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T085637Z/decision_log_audit/health/last_health.json` -> `GREEN`, `lineage_unresolved_total=0`.
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T085637Z/decision_fabric/health/last_health.json` -> `GREEN`.
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T085637Z/action_layer/health/last_health.json` -> `GREEN` with intake/outcome parity.
    - `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260212T085637Z/obs/environment_conformance.json` -> `status=PASS`.
  - Notes appended:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Post-apply correction completed:
    - nested env-token fallback in `local_parity_learning_jobs.v0.yaml` proved incompatible with run-operate token parser.
    - updated approach:
      - keep pack tokens flat (`${PARITY_OFS_RUN_LEDGER_DSN:-}`, `${PARITY_MF_RUN_LEDGER_DSN:-}`),
      - inject resolved parity DSN vars from make defaults in `platform-operate-learning-jobs-{up,down,restart,status}`.
    - validation:
      - `make platform-operate-learning-jobs-status` clean,
      - malformed literal artifact removed after learning-jobs restart.

* 10:31AM
  - Opened targeted IG auth-remediation pass for ops endpoints after USER request.
  - Problem pinned:
    - unauthenticated `GET /v1/ops/health` currently returns `500` instead of `401`.
  - Root cause pinned in implementation map:
    - `ops_health` and `ops_lookup` call `_require_auth` without `IngestionError` handling.
  - Plan:
    - align ops route error mapping with `ingest_push` (`IngestionError -> _error_status`),
    - add/extend tests for unauthorized and authorized ops endpoint behavior,
    - validate locally.

* 10:37AM
  - Applied IG ops endpoint auth error mapping fix:
    - updated `src/fraud_detection/ingestion_gate/service.py` so `/v1/ops/lookup` and `/v1/ops/health` catch `IngestionError` and return mapped status codes.
  - Added regression tests:
    - `tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase5_auth_rate.py`
      - `test_ops_health_requires_api_key`
      - `test_ops_lookup_requires_api_key`
  - Test validation:
    - `pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase5_auth_rate.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_phase4_service.py -q`
    - result: `7 passed`.
  - Runtime validation after `make platform-operate-control-ingress-restart`:
    - unauth `GET /v1/ops/health` -> `401` with `{"error":"UNAUTHORIZED"}`,
    - auth `GET /v1/ops/health` (`X-IG-Api-Key: local-parity-wsp`) -> `200` with `{"state":"GREEN","reasons":[]}`.
  - Notes appended:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md`

* 11:25AM
  - Reorganized docs/design/platform/local-parity file naming from numeric placeholders to ordered descriptive names.
  - Applied canonical structure requested by USER:
    - main doc = 1_spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.md
    - Addendum 1 = 2_addendum_1_phase_state_machine_and_gates.md, 3_addendum_1_operator_gate_checklist.md, 4_addendum_1_phase_to_packaging_map.md

  - Populated docs/design/platform/local-parity/README.md as folder router with scope, reading order, and document-role mapping.
  - Verification: scanned docs/ for references to old 1.md..8.md names; no matches found.

* 11:28AM

  - Corrected local-parity index filename to README.txt (previously remained README.md after batch rename).

* 11:44AM
  - Hardened main local-parity narrative to match executed Spine Green v0 runtime contract:
    - file: docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
    - added Spine-safe status commands (without learning-jobs by default) and clarified full parity status behavior,
    - pinned bounded manual stream command to WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT=200 (+ optional 20->200 gate pattern),
    - aligned SR/WSP/IG log/artifact paths with run-operate pack locations,
    - documented IG ops-health auth contract (401 unauth / 200 auth),
    - documented expected duplicate READY skip behavior,
    - added AL/DLA first-read trim_horizon run-scoped startup invariant,
    - added strict closeout evidence packet and pass conditions,
    - added optional substrate teardown command.
  - Decision trail appended to docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md

* 11:56AM
  - Audited docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md for recruiter-story quality across all IDs.
  - Ran full-coverage structural/depth checks:
    - confirmed 248/248 IDs contain the required sections (Context, Problem, Options, Decision, Implementation, Result, Why, Truth posture, Evidence anchors, Additional challenge context),
    - confirmed no thin entries by total-length guardrail (all IDs above low-word threshold used in audit pass).
  - Applied normalization fixes to close remaining format drift:
    - added Truth posture to ID 1 and ID 2,
    - renamed non-standard additional-context labels in ID 1 and ID 3 to Additional challenge context.
  - Post-fix verification:
    - Truth posture present in 248/248 IDs,
    - Additional challenge context present in 248/248 IDs,
    - options section count valid (2-3) across all IDs.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no runtime services touched.

* 11:56AM
  - Implemented hybrid run-operate artifact topology after USER discussion/recommendation confirmation.
  - Challenge documented and solved:
    - prevent cross-run log/event conflation in run-operate while preserving stable operator control surface.
  - Code change: src/fraud_detection/run_operate/orchestrator.py
    - state/status remain pack-scoped under runs/fraud-platform/operate/<pack_id>/...
    - process logs/events now run-scoped under runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/operate/<pack_id>/... when run id is available.
    - status output now prefers persisted process log_path from state records.
  - Test added: tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py
    - test_logs_and_events_are_run_scoped_but_state_status_remain_pack_scoped.
  - Test validation:
    - .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests/services/run_operate/test_orchestrator.py -q
    - result: 6 passed.
  - Main narrative updated:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
    - run-operate artifact paths now reflect hybrid layout (pack-scoped control + run-scoped logs/events).
  - Detailed decision trail and recommendation recorded in:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md


* 12:04PM
  - Reordered tail IDs in docs/references/challenge_story_bank.md to strict ascending sequence.
  - Change scope: moved only ID blocks 245, 246, 247, 248 (content unchanged).
  - Verified post-change tail order: 245 -> 246 -> 247 -> 248.
  - Structural check after reorder: all 248 ID blocks still satisfy required story sections.

* 12:08PM
  - Hardened Addendum 1 phase-state-machine doc to align with current canonical Spine Green runtime behavior:
    - file: docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_state_machine_and_gates.txt
    - clarified P2 Spine-safe status posture and full-parity/learning status caveat,
    - aligned P2 evidence to pack-scoped control files + run-scoped process log paths,
    - aligned P4 gate to IG auth contract (401 unauth / 200 authenticated health),
    - corrected P5 READY evidence source to SR run log wording,
    - aligned P6 evidence path to run-scoped WSP ready-consumer log,
    - tightened P9 closure with DLA GREEN + lineage_unresolved_total=0,
    - tightened P11 conformance gate to explicit status PASS.
  - Validation: post-edit marker scan passed for all targeted canonical anchors.
  - Decision trail appended in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md

* 12:13PM

    - updated P2 status checks to Spine-safe pack commands (+ parity status learning caveat),
    - clarified P3c logical required surfaces vs dataset-specific output_id examples,
    - pinned P4 IG auth health contract (401 unauth / 200 authenticated),
    - anchored P5 SR READY evidence to scenario_runner run log path,
    - anchored P6 WSP evidence to run-scoped operate log path and Gate-200 emitted=200 expectation,
    - tightened P8 IEG reconciliation path and P9 DLA closure criterion,
    - tightened P11 conformance criterion to status=PASS + no concurrent reporter/manual writes,
    - made Gate-20/Gate-200 caps explicit via WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT env values.
  - Validation: post-edit marker scan passed for all targeted canonical anchors.
  - Decision trail appended in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md

* 12:20PM
  - Clarified LS runtime-role terminology across local-parity migration docs per USER request.
  - Core clarification pinned:
    - LS writer boundary = authority role (label truth semantics),
    - local_parity runtime shape = daemon worker label_store_worker (case_labels pack).
  - Updated files:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_2_process_job_cards.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_4_io_ownership_matrix.txt
  - Also replaced remaining vague 'as implemented' wording in touched sections with concrete wording.
  - Decision trail appended in docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md

* 12:24PM
  - Completed full blind-spot read across three active migration docs:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_state_machine_and_gates.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_operator_gate_checklist.txt
  - Found and fixed one substantive ambiguity:
    - normalized <run_id> references to <platform_run_id> in Addendum 1 docs to avoid confusion with scenario_run_id.
  - Post-fix validation:
    - no residual <run_id> placeholders in the two Addendum 1 docs,
    - canonical gate markers remain present across all three docs (status/auth/bounded gates/DLA closure/conformance/LS runtime role).
  - Detailed closure note appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 12:31PM
  - Expanded main local-parity narrative depth after USER concern about RTDL/Case-Labels being glossed over.
  - Updated file: docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
  - Applied machinery-level detail in sections 8/9/10:
    - RTDL core: archive_writer_worker, ieg_projector, ofp_projector, csfb_intake
    - RTDL decision lane: dl_worker, df_worker, al_worker, dla_worker
    - Case/Labels: case_trigger_worker, case_mgmt_worker, label_store_worker
  - Added for each runtime unit:
    - entrypoint module, run pin/store context, commit-evidence path, and closure expectations.
  - Outcome: main doc now reflects in-scope planes as operational machinery (not abstract services), reducing migration blind spots.
  - Corrective pre-change note + applied closure recorded in dev_substrate implementation map.

* 12:44PM
  - Reviewed `docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_to_packaging_map.txt` for migration consistency.
  - Applied one namespace correction in P11:
    - replaced legacy `<run_id>` with `<platform_run_id>` in reporter evidence path example.
  - Validation:
    - marker scan confirms no `<run_id>` placeholder remains in this file.
    - path now aligns with other Addendum 1 docs (`evidence/runs/<platform_run_id>/...`).
  - Implementation note appended:
    - `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`
  - Additional wording normalization in same file:
    - P1 now states `platform_run_id fixed for all processes` (replacing `run_id`).
  - Reason: avoid confusion with scenario_run_id during migration operations.

* 12:46PM
  - Started sequential hardening pass for remaining local-parity docs per USER direction.

  - Detailed pre-change note appended to dev_substrate implementation map.
  - Completed Addendum 2 hardening (`addendum_2_process_job_cards.txt`).
  - Applied fixes: run-operate hybrid paths, WSP mode-specific log paths, IG health auth contract note, and `<platform_run_id>` normalization in Obs/Gov path.
  - Validation scan passed (no `<run_id>` residual in Addendum 2).
  - Addendum 3 review found one ambiguity in SR lease cleanup wording.
  - Added file-specific pre-change note; applying a narrow wording clarification for SR lease identity scope.
  - Completed Addendum 3 wording fix: clarified SR surgical lease cleanup scope to scenario/equivalence-key identity.
  - Validation scan passed for lease wording section.
  - Addendum 3 additional normalization: replaced `platform run_id` with `platform_run_id`.
  - Starting Addendum 4 normalization pass for legacy `<run_id>` placeholders.
  - Goal: align all platform-run artifact paths to `<platform_run_id>` while preserving scenario-scoped references.
  - Pre-change note appended to dev_substrate implementation map.
  - Completed Addendum 4 hardening (`addendum_4_io_ownership_matrix.txt`).
  - Applied broad namespace normalization (`<run_id>` -> `<platform_run_id>`) and clarified IG/WSP pack-managed runtime paths.
  - Added IG health auth contract note in endpoint registry.
  - Validation passed: no residual `<run_id>` in Addendum 4.
  - Addendum 5 review identified two consistency nits: knob name alias and generic run identity label.

  - Cross-file validation complete: no residual `<run_id>` placeholders in local-parity folder.

* 1:11PM
  - Opened comprehensive docs gate-hardening pass for Spine Green v0 per USER request.
  - Target files: main process flow, Addendum 1 state machine, Addendum 1 operator checklist, Addendum 2 job cards.
  - Goal: remove false-green paths and require artifact-based closure for IG, RTDL core, and Case+Labels.
  - Pre-change decision entry appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 1:14PM
  - Applied comprehensive docs gate hardening for Spine Green v0 (runtime-truth alignment).
  - Updated files:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_state_machine_and_gates.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_operator_gate_checklist.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_2_process_job_cards.txt
  - Key outcomes:
    - strict closeout now includes RTDL core + Case/Labels artifact-based closure,
    - IG admission gate now requires positive admit signal (not receipts-only),
    - archive and case/labels are no longer optionalized in closure wording,
    - CM/LS job cards now include checkpoint/env/fail-closed/reset details.
  - Validation scans completed; no `<run_id>` regressions introduced.
  - Decision trail appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 1:16PM
  - Started runbook authority-clarification pass per USER request.
  - Target: docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md
  - Planned additions: explicit full-parity-vs-Spine-Green scope note + run-operate artifact topology clarification.
  - Pre-change note appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 1:18PM
  - Updated runbook authority posture and topology notes:
    - file: docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md
  - Added explicit full-parity vs Spine Green v0 scope-authority section.
  - Corrected Run/Operate artifact paths to current hybrid topology (run-scoped logs/events).
  - Added section note clarifying learning_jobs commands are superset, not Spine Green baseline requirement.
  - Decision trail appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 1:32PM
  - Opened managed-compute-only repin pass per USER directive (no laptop compute).
  - Conflict pinned: dev-min authority currently says local compute default.
  - Target updates:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_to_packaging_map.txt
  - Pre-change repin note appended to dev_substrate implementation map.

* 1:36PM
  - Completed managed-compute-only repin documentation updates (no laptop runtime compute).
  - Updated authority doc:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md
  - Updated migration packaging map:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_1_phase_to_packaging_map.txt
  - Outcomes:
    - dev-min compute now pinned to ephemeral ECS tasks/services,
    - local-runtime compute posture removed from dev-min authority sections,
    - runtime identity/state-store language aligned to managed runtime posture.
  - Validation scans confirm conflicting local-default compute phrases removed in touched docs.

* 1:40PM
  - Opened engine-remediation planning track for Segment 1A per USER direction (plan first, no implementation yet).
  - Created dedicated engine build plan:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md
  - Plan contents pinned:
    - state-by-state remediation blueprint for S0-S9,
    - hard-gate-first certification posture (B first, then B+ uplift),
    - fail-closed phase progression with explicit DoD per phase,
    - run isolation under runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/... .
  - Appended matching decision entry to:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md
  - Hygiene correction:
    - removed sidecar log file and consolidated into this daily log format.

* 1:45PM
  - Refactored Segment 1A engine remediation build plan to explicit phase-first format per USER request.
  - Updated file:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md
  - Structure change applied:
    - each phase now has goal, states in play, sections, DoD checklist, and explicit exit gate.
  - Added supporting matrix:
    - state responsibility by phase (P0..P4) for quick execution ownership clarity.
  - Preserved unchanged constraints:
    - hard-gate contract, run isolation under runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/..., fail-closed progression.
  - Decision note appended:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md

* 1:55PM
  - Re-pinned Segment 1A build plan to reflect sequential-run reality with explicit remediation priority by state.
  - Updated file:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md
  - Clarified execution law:
    - all runs execute `S0->S9` sequentially.
  - Clarified remediation focus:
    - primary states: `S8`, `S3`, `S6`, `S2`
    - conditional state: `S1`
    - check/pass-through states: `S4`, `S7`, `S0`, `S5`, `S9`
  - Plan tone narrowed to data-first outcomes to avoid "remediate everything" interpretation.
  - Matching decision note appended to:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md

* 2:36PM
  - Replaced Segment 1A build plan with state-phased format per USER direction.
  - Updated file:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.build_plan.md
  - New structure pinned:
    - Phase 0..5,
    - explicit focus states per phase,
    - DoD checklist per phase,
    - sequential run law (`S0->S9`) retained.
  - Began remediation execution at Phase 0 baseline lock:
    - full sequential baseline run in `runs/fix-data-engine/segment_1A/...`,
    - baseline fail-matrix extraction planned immediately after run completion.
  - Detailed pre-run entry appended to:
    - docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md

* 1:50PM
  - Opened and completed option-1 closure pass for remaining migration decision pins in dev-min authority.
  - Updated file:
    - docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md
  - Decisions pinned explicitly:
    - IG dedupe identity must use (platform_run_id, event_class, event_id) end-to-end,
    - IG/CM/LS runtime state must use managed backends (no laptop-resident runtime DB),
    - Obs/Gov governance append path must enforce single-writer lock with fail-closed conflict evidence.
  - Additional alignment edits:
    - removed residual local-compute allowance in section 11.3,
    - replaced stale CM/LS local-runtime freedom with managed-engine-only freedom,
    - added semantic gate for Obs/Gov writer-law preservation,
    - added decision-registry closures for all three items.
  - Validation scan completed for key markers:
    - `(platform_run_id, event_class, event_id)`
    - `single-writer`
    - `S3_APPEND_CONFLICT`
    - no remaining `compute is local` allowance in section 11.3.
  - Drift sentinel assessment:
    - docs-only authority closure to mirror intended runtime truth; no code/runtime behavior changed in this step.

* 2:35PM
  - Patched remaining local-parity doc drifts to align with pinned dev_min migration decisions while preserving local runtime truth.
  - Updated files:
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_2_process_job_cards.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/addendum_3_rerun_cleanup_matrix.txt
    - docs/design/platform/local-parity/spine_green_v0_run_process_flow.txt
  - Applied fixes:
    - removed IG downstream-lane output contradictions from Addendum 2,
    - reframed IG dedupe-key gap as migration blocker (not acceptable for dev_min green),
    - added explicit publish-ambiguity modeling requirement note,
    - bounded CM sqlite checkpoint as local_parity-only and added managed-backend requirement for dev_min,
    - added strict-closeout portability note mapping dev_min promotion evidence to S3 `evidence/runs/<platform_run_id>/...`.
  - Validation markers confirmed expected insertions/removals.
  - Drift sentinel assessment:
    - docs-only alignment; no runtime behavior/code changed in this step.
