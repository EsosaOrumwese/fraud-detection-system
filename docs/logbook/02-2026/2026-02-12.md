* 4:30AM
  - Captured migration challenge raised by USER in active platform planning:
    - problem: moving from local-compute success to managed dev-substrate portability lacked an explicit cross-phase checklist.
  - Added binding section to `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - `## Local-to-Managed Compute Migration Playbook (binding across phases)`.
  - Section now pins required migration mechanics:
    - local coupling inventory,
    - managed execution package contract,
    - managed-lane preflight,
    - cutover/rollback criteria,
    - portability acceptance proof (`run anywhere` evidence).
  - Tightened Phase `3.C` progression rule:
    - each component migration gate must satisfy this playbook before acceptance-valid status.
  - Related implementation-map entries appended:
    - pre-change lock + applied closure in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.

* 4:46AM
  - Added explicit migration-solution lock requested by USER in active plan:
    - migration must start with a full decomposition of "what worked locally" (every process/subprocess), not only service-level labels.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.build_plan.md`:
    - inserted `0. Local run process decomposition baseline (mandatory first)` inside the local-to-managed playbook,
    - required artifact: `Local Run Process Inventory Matrix`,
    - added DoD item requiring matrix completion per active corridor before acceptance progression.
  - Updated `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md`:
    - appended pre-change lock + applied closure entries.
  - Cost posture:
    - docs-only pass; no paid services touched.
