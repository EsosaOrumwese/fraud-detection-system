   - Changes made to align 2A with the rest of Layer‑1 and teach the tooling about its own manifest:
      - Segment 2A S0 gate: reverted the temporary fingerprint guard so the gate once again seals its own inputs, as the spec requires.
      - Scenario runner & CLI: Segment2AResult now carries the segment’s parameter_hash; the CLI summary includes it, and there’s a new optional --result-json flag that writes runs/.../segment2a_result.json capturing S0–S5 outputs, fingerprints, and resume status. Resume mode now reads the receipt to recover the hash.
      - Makefile workflow: added SEG2A_RESULT_JSON (default runs/local_layer1_regen0/segment2a_result.json). make segment2a now emits this file automatically. make segment2b loads the manifest/parameter hash from that summary (while still using the 1A fingerprint to locate the 1B validation bundle), so S3 resolves site_timezones under the correct {seed,fingerprint}. clean-results now deletes both segment summaries.
