* 3:42am
   * Added synthetic S2/S3 implementations to extend 3B:
      - S2 edge catalogue (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3B/s2_edges/l2/runner.py): loads S0/S1 outputs, merchant universe, and sealed inputs; builds deterministic edge rows (one edge per virtual merchant) and index; writes run-report and segment-state report.
      - S3 alias packaging (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3B/s3_alias/l2/runner.py): consumes S2 outputs, produces alias blob/index, and a universe-hash JSON; emits run-report and segment-state report.
      - Exported new runners in seg_3B/__init__.py, wired orchestration options in scenario_runner/l1_seg_3B.py and CLI flags --run-s2/--run-s3 in engine.cli.segment3b.
      - Marked TODOs on synthetic datasets; kept S1 test passing.
