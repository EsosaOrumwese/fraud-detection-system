* 3:42am
   * Added synthetic S2/S3 implementations to extend 3B:
      - S2 edge catalogue (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3B/s2_edges/l2/runner.py): loads S0/S1 outputs, merchant universe, and sealed inputs; builds deterministic edge rows (one edge per virtual merchant) and index; writes run-report and segment-state report.
      - S3 alias packaging (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3B/s3_alias/l2/runner.py): consumes S2 outputs, produces alias blob/index, and a universe-hash JSON; emits run-report and segment-state report.
      - Exported new runners in seg_3B/__init__.py, wired orchestration options in scenario_runner/l1_seg_3B.py and CLI flags --run-s2/--run-s3 in engine.cli.segment3b.
      - Marked TODOs on synthetic datasets; kept S1 test passing.

* 04:50am
   - Country polygons: Natural Earth admin-0 110m GeoJSON downloaded and tracked at `reference/spatial/world_countries/2024-11-27/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson` (canonical for now).
   - Timezones: Timezone Boundary Builder 2024b shapefile+zip under `artefacts/spatial/tz_world/2024b/raw/`; tzdb archive 2024b at `reference/time/tzdb/2024b/tzdata2024b.tar.gz`.
   - IP geo: MaxMind GeoLite2 Country downloaded with provided key to `reference/ip_geo/maxmind_geolite2/20251127/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` (with COPYRIGHT/LICENSE).
   - Synthetic policies still in place (TODO to replace with governed): `mcc_channel_rules` (synthetic-v0.3), `cdn_country_weights` (synthetic-v0.3 from population), `virtual_settlement_coords` (country centroids), `virtual_validation` (synthetic tolerances).
   - Possible to acquire next: Cloudflare Radar country-traffic snapshot (to seed `web_traffic_by_country`), HRSL rasters (need scope), Overture Places POI base (need release/filter).
- Not externally obtainable: governed MCC policy, real settlement coords/tz/evidence, governed validation policy, edge RNG/alias layout policies and per-merchant overrides.

* 05:10am
   - Downloaded Cloudflare Radar HTTP traffic snapshot (30d, top locations) using provided API token; saved to `reference/web_traffic/cloudflare_radar/20251127/traffic_by_country.{json,csv}`. Updated dataset dictionary entry `web_traffic_by_country` with version `radar_http_top_locations_30d` and snapshot path.
