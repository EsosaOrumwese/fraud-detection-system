   - Cloned the governed baseline scenario calendar into a manifest-scoped path (`config/layer2/5A/scenario/calendar/fingerprint=7a09f0d8e8695beead7077abc7a1e7478586ae1396fe7be2f5c2b0f7cdd53f69/scenario=baseline/`) so S0 no longer falls back to the repo-wide placeholder when sealing scenario artefacts for the current build. Future manifests now just need their own copy (real data once available) and the fallback remains a contingency.
   - TODO: Most of the arrangements of the items in folders in my repo and during run time, just don't make sense and also appear to be all over the place. We need to fix that

* 4:52am
   - Rewired 5A scenario calendars to be staged at runtime instead of committing manifest-specific Parquet files: the dictionary/registry now point at `data/layer2/5A/scenario/calendar/...` under the run tree, S0 auto-generates the missing files by copying from the governed templates in `config/layer2/5A/scenario/calendar/fingerprint=baseline/...`, and sealing now prefers the run base path for any dataset that lives under `data/`. 
   - Added `shared/scenario_assets.py` with `ensure_scenario_calendar` and removed the previously committed fingerprint directory so the repo stays clean between manifests.

* 4:57am
   - Implemented 5A.S3 per spec (scale×shape composer): added BaselineRunner to compose S1 profiles with S2 unit-mass shapes, enforce weekly-sum invariants, and emit schema-valid `merchant_zone_baseline_local_5A` plus class-level aggregates. Orchestrator/CLI now run S3 by default (with resumability/conflict guards) and surface baseline paths in the summary. Re-ran `make segment5a` (manifest 7a09…, parameter hash e038…) end-to-end through S0–S3; outputs and reports regenerated without spec gaps.
