* 3:33pm
   * Began work on implementing segment 3A
   * Implemented initial Segment 3A S0 gate scaffolding:
      - Added 3A package and S0 gate modules (exceptions, sealed artefact dataclass, runner) under `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_3A/…`.
      - Runner verifies upstream 1A/1B/2A validation bundles (defaulting to data/layer1/{seg}/validation/fingerprint=<fp>), hashes policy packs (mixture, country_zone_alphas, zone_floor_policy, day_effect_policy_v1), computes parameter/manifest hashes, writes s0_gate_receipt_3A.json and sealed_inputs_3A.parquet, and emits a small determinism receipt.
      - Dictionary fallback points to the spec copy at docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3A.yaml unless overridden.

* 4:00pm
   - Wired Segment 3A S0 into the tooling:
      - Added 3A shared dictionary loader, S0 gate runner refinements (proper default dictionary, deterministic receipt path in outputs), and exported segment package.
      - Created Segment 3A orchestrator and CLI (engine.scenario_runner.l1_seg_3A, engine.cli.segment3a) with resume support and validation bundle overrides; updated CLI exports.
      - Added a runtime 3A dataset dictionary copy under contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_3A/layer1.3A.yaml.
      - Introduced a Makefile target segment3a plus variables/command wiring using existing run-root, upstream bundles, and summaries.
      - Included a focused 3A S0 gate unit test; updated S0 outputs to carry determinism receipt path.
