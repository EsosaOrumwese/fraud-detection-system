  * Haven't been able to do much this weekend cus I really need to make sure I understand this code, what's going on before I push it.
  * Tasks for tomorrow:
    * Complete my integration and verification of the perfect flow code
    * Move to the Dockerfile (do same; improve, test, explain) -> GitHub actions -> DuckDB validator CLI -> Parquet row-group statistics tweak
    * ~~Look at adding seasonality spikes to `generate.py` and other affected files~~ Integrate it to the task below; 
    * In order to make our data not just "fake" but more synthetic fraud data, we'll try to employ
      - entity catalogues & Zipf sampling
      - time-of-day / weekday seasonality
      - scenario-based fraud injection
