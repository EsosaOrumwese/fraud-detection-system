* 12:03am
   - Confirmed S4 completion for run_id `04ffabbdfbd34b9d8a4d61e7be70782b` from the run log (`S4: run report written` and `S4 1B complete`).
   - Verified `s4_run_report.json` contains required fields (`seed`, `manifest_fingerprint`, `parameter_hash`, `rows_emitted`, `merchants_total`, `pairs_total`, `alloc_sum_equals_requirements`, `ingress_versions`, `determinism_receipt`) plus PAT counters.
   - Logged S4 green status and spec compliance in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`.

* 12:08am
   - Reviewed `state.1B.s5.expanded.md` and the 1B contract authority for S5 (`s5_site_tile_assignment`, `s5_run_report`, `rng_event_site_tile_assign`, `rng_audit_log`).
   - Logged a detailed pre‑implementation plan for S5 in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md`, including RNG envelope handling, per‑pair assignment logic, external‑sort posture, and run‑report requirements.
   - Raised three confirmations needed before coding: run_id source for RNG logs, pair‑scoped RNG derivation, and external‑sort threshold.
