### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:08am
   - Read `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2A/state.2A.s1.expanded.md`
     to confirm the country-singleton fallback rule and run-report obligations.
   - Added a pre-implementation plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:07) to normalize country lookup for the fallback
     and emit unresolved ambiguity diagnostics in the S1 run-report.

* 12:09am
   - Implemented normalized country-key lookup for the country-singleton
     fallback in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s1_tz_lookup/runner.py`.
   - Added bounded unresolved-ambiguity diagnostics to the S1 run-report.
   - Logged the implementation details in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:09).

* 12:20am
   - Fixed an `IndentationError` in
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s1_tz_lookup/runner.py` by
     realigning the `checks` and ambiguity tracker initialization block.
   - Recorded the correction in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:20).

* 12:25am
   - Repaired the S1 ambiguity override flow so country overrides are applied
     before fallback/failure, using a normalized `country_key`.
   - Fixed the S1 run-report writer scope to avoid `UnboundLocalError` when
     `merchant_mcc_map` is absent.
   - Logged the update in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:25).

* 12:32am
   - Investigated `2B-S0-080` while rerunning `make segment2b`; confirmed the
     S0 receipt was non-identical on re-run because `verified_at_utc` is
     generated from the current time.
   - Added a detailed plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:32) to make receipt timestamps deterministic by
     anchoring them to `run_receipt.created_utc`.

* 12:34am
   - Implemented deterministic receipt timestamps in
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s0_gate/runner.py` by
     sourcing `verified_at_utc` from `run_receipt.created_utc` and warning
     when missing.

* 12:35am
   - Observed that the legacy receipt on disk still differs from the new
     deterministic timestamp, causing `2B-S0-080` to persist.
   - Added a new implementation-map entry
     (`docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     Entry: 2026-01-17 00:35) to reuse `verified_at_utc` from the existing
     receipt when present.

* 12:37am
   - Updated `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s0_gate/runner.py`
     to reuse `verified_at_utc` from any existing S0 receipt before
     constructing the payload, keeping write-once idempotence for reruns.

* 12:40am
   - Generated the run-scoped 2B arrival roster via
     `make segment2b-arrival-roster RUN_ID=2b22ab5c8c7265882ca6e50375802b26`.
   - Removed run-local partitions for `s0_gate_receipt`, `sealed_inputs`,
     and `s1_site_weights`/`s2_alias_*`/`s3_day_effects`/`s4_group_weights`
     so S0 can reseal with the roster and S1-S4 can regenerate under the
     new receipt timestamp.

* 1:00am
   - Cleared run-local 2B S5 RNG outputs that were blocking a deterministic
     re-run (`logs/layer1/2B/rng/events/alias_pick_group`,
     `logs/layer1/2B/rng/events/alias_pick_site`, and
     `logs/layer1/2B/rng/trace` for run_id `2b22ab5c8c7265882ca6e50375802b26`).
   - Re-ran `make segment2b-s5 segment2b-s6` and confirmed S5/S6 completed

* 7:16am
   - Re-read `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2B/state.2B.s7.expanded.md`
     (V-12 through V-16) to align the RNG evidence checks with spec wording.
   - Added a detailed S7 completion plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 07:16) covering streamed JSONL validation, RNG evidence
     reconciliation, mapping checks, audit report emission, and CLI/Makefile wiring.

* 7:29am
   - Finished the 2B.S7 runner logic in
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s7_audit/runner.py`:
     added streamed JSONL iterators, RNG evidence reconciliation
     (event logs + trace log + audit log), mapping checks against
     `site_timezones` and `virtual_edge_policy_v1`, and audit report
     creation with write-once atomic publish.
   - Added CLI `packages/engine/src/engine/cli/s7_audit_2b.py` and Makefile
     wiring (`SEG2B_S7_CMD`, `segment2b-s7`, and `segment2b` chain update).
   - Implementation details logged in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 07:16).
     successfully after the log cleanup.

* 6:13am
   - Logged the decision to lock a deterministic 10% virtual mix for
     `s5_arrival_roster` using a hash of `(merchant_id, seed)` so S6 is exercised
     without external 5B inputs.
   - Added a detailed implementation plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 06:13) to update the roster normalization script.

* 6:14am
   - Implemented deterministic 10% `is_virtual` assignment in
     `scripts/normalize_arrival_roster.py` using SHA-256 bucketing of
     `(merchant_id, seed)` and a fixed `VIRTUAL_PERCENT=10`.
   - Recorded the implementation details in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 06:14).

* 6:20am
   - Reviewed `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2B/state.2B.s7.expanded.md`
     plus the S7-related contracts in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.2B.yaml`,
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/artefact_registry_2B.yaml`,
     and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml`
     to prepare the S7 audit/CI gate implementation.
   - Logged the pre-implementation reasoning and open confirmations in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 06:20).

* 6:22am
   - Confirmed S7 decisions: skip optional logs when absent (no WARN), emit
     STDOUT-only run-report, restrict `inputs_digest` to S0-sealed assets, and
     hard-fail if S5/S6 logs are present but RNG evidence logs are missing.
   - Logged the decisions in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 06:22).

* 6:35am
   - Added a detailed S7 implementation plan (inputs, checks, outputs, wiring,
     and test steps) in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 06:35) before coding the S7 runner/CLI/Makefile changes.

* 7:00am
   - Inspected the partially built
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s7_audit/runner.py` and found
     it ends after optional S5/S6 log validation, missing the remaining S7
     checks and report publishing.
   - Logged a continuation entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 07:00) to finish the runner, then wire CLI/Makefile.
