* 12:08am
   - Read `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2A/state.2A.s1.expanded.md`
     to confirm the country-singleton fallback rule and run-report obligations.
   - Added a pre-implementation plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:07) to normalize country lookup for the fallback
     and emit unresolved ambiguity diagnostics in the S1 run-report.

* 12:09am
   - Implemented normalized country-key lookup for the country-singleton
     fallback in `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s1_tz_lookup/runner.py`.
   - Added bounded unresolved-ambiguity diagnostics to the S1 run-report.
   - Logged the implementation details in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:09).

* 12:20am
   - Fixed an `IndentationError` in
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2A/s1_tz_lookup/runner.py` by
     realigning the `checks` and ambiguity tracker initialization block.
   - Recorded the correction in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:20).

* 12:25am
   - Repaired the S1 ambiguity override flow so country overrides are applied
     before fallback/failure, using a normalized `country_key`.
   - Fixed the S1 run-report writer scope to avoid `UnboundLocalError` when
     `merchant_mcc_map` is absent.
   - Logged the update in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:25).

* 12:32am
   - Investigated `2B-S0-080` while rerunning `make segment2b`; confirmed the
     S0 receipt was non-identical on re-run because `verified_at_utc` is
     generated from the current time.
   - Added a detailed plan entry in
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     (Entry: 2026-01-17 00:32) to make receipt timestamps deterministic by
     anchoring them to `run_receipt.created_utc`.

* 12:34am
   - Implemented deterministic receipt timestamps in
     `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s0_gate/runner.py` by
     sourcing `verified_at_utc` from `run_receipt.created_utc` and warning
     when missing.

* 12:35am
   - Observed that the legacy receipt on disk still differs from the new
     deterministic timestamp, causing `2B-S0-080` to persist.
   - Added a new implementation-map entry
     (`docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2B.impl_actual.md`
     Entry: 2026-01-17 00:35) to reuse `verified_at_utc` from the existing
     receipt when present.

* 12:37am
   - Updated `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_2B/s0_gate/runner.py`
     to reuse `verified_at_utc` from any existing S0 receipt before
     constructing the payload, keeping write-once idempotence for reruns.

* 12:40am
   - Generated the run-scoped 2B arrival roster via
     `make segment2b-arrival-roster RUN_ID=2b22ab5c8c7265882ca6e50375802b26`.
   - Removed run-local partitions for `s0_gate_receipt`, `sealed_inputs`,
     and `s1_site_weights`/`s2_alias_*`/`s3_day_effects`/`s4_group_weights`
     so S0 can reseal with the roster and S1-S4 can regenerate under the
     new receipt timestamp.

* 1:00am
   - Cleared run-local 2B S5 RNG outputs that were blocking a deterministic
     re-run (`logs/layer1/2B/rng/events/alias_pick_group`,
     `logs/layer1/2B/rng/events/alias_pick_site`, and
     `logs/layer1/2B/rng/trace` for run_id `2b22ab5c8c7265882ca6e50375802b26`).
   - Re-ran `make segment2b-s5 segment2b-s6` and confirmed S5/S6 completed
     successfully after the log cleanup.
