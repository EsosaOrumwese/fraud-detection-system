   - Fixed 5B.S4 site lookup join failure by normalizing join key dtypes (cast merchant_id to UInt64, site_order to UInt32, and ISO/tzid to Utf8) for both `s1_site_weights` and `site_timezones`, matching schema expectations and preventing u64↔str join mismatches (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l2/seg_5B/s4_arrivals/runner.py`).
