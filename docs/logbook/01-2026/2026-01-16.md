   - Added the optional `s5_arrival_roster` contract surfaces for 2B.S5:
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml`,
     `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.2B.yaml`,
     and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/artefact_registry_2B.yaml`.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2B/state.2B.s5.expanded.md`
     to document the optional run-scoped arrival roster and its partition law.
   - Aligned `config/layer1/2B/policy/route_rng_policy_v1.json` to the schema +
     authoring guide (policy_id/rng_engine/streams + selection_log_enabled flag).
