   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to anchor the 3A alignment edits.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3A.yaml` to normalize the `outlet_catalogue` path/partitioning, add the optional `s4_legality_report` ingress reference, and register `rng_audit_log`, `rng_trace_log`, and `rng_event_zone_dirichlet` for S3 RNG evidence.
   - Expanded `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/artefact_registry_3A.yaml` with explicit cross-layer pointers (upstream bundles/flags, ingress/egress pins, optional diagnostics), plus 3A RNG core logs and event family entries, and aligned dependency references to manifest keys.
   - Added the `rng/events/zone_dirichlet` schema anchor to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/schemas.layer1.yaml` to match the 3A S3 event family.
   - Removed `tz_index_manifest` references from `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/3A/state.3A.s0.expanded.md` so the S0 manifest only pins `tz_world` and `tz_timetable_cache`.
   - Validated YAML parsing for the updated 3A dictionary, 3A registry, and Layer-1 schema pack files.
