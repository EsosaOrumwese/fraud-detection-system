* 12:58am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to anchor the 3A alignment edits.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3A.yaml` to normalize the `outlet_catalogue` path/partitioning, add the optional `s4_legality_report` ingress reference, and register `rng_audit_log`, `rng_trace_log`, and `rng_event_zone_dirichlet` for S3 RNG evidence.
   - Expanded `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3A/artefact_registry_3A.yaml` with explicit cross-layer pointers (upstream bundles/flags, ingress/egress pins, optional diagnostics), plus 3A RNG core logs and event family entries, and aligned dependency references to manifest keys.
   - Added the `rng/events/zone_dirichlet` schema anchor to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/schemas.layer1.yaml` to match the 3A S3 event family.
   - Removed `tz_index_manifest` references from `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/3A/state.3A.s0.expanded.md` so the S0 manifest only pins `tz_world` and `tz_timetable_cache`.
   - Validated YAML parsing for the updated 3A dictionary, 3A registry, and Layer-1 schema pack files.

* 1:28am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to anchor review of the 3B alignment recommendations.
   - Reviewed `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3B.yaml` and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` to compare dictionary vs registry coverage and identify drift (run reports, RNG logs/events, upstream inputs, and legacy non-contract entries).

* 2:00am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to anchor the 3B contract alignment edits.
   - Added upstream cross-layer inputs and policy pointers to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3B.yaml` (outlet catalogue, 2A time assets, 3A zone outputs, transaction schema merchant IDs, and routing policy inputs).
   - Added 3B RNG evidence entries (`rng_audit_log`, `rng_trace_log`, `rng_event_edge_tile_assign`, `rng_event_edge_jitter`) and aligned `cdn_weights_ext_yaml` licensing in the 3B dictionary.
   - Expanded `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` with explicit contract outputs, run reports, RNG logs/events, and upstream inputs; aligned `gamma_draw_log_3B`, `virtual_settlement_coords` versioning, and `virtual_routing_policy_3B` dependencies to dictionary IDs.
   - Validated YAML parsing for the updated 3B dictionary and registry files.

* 5:13am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to timestamp the 3B registry-only scan.
   - Parsed `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` against `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/dataset_dictionary.layer1.3B.yaml` to enumerate registry-only entries for the non-contract cleanup discussion.

* 5:34am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to timestamp the 3B non-contract cleanup.
   - Removed non-contract entries (code/tests/docs/schema assets/legacy helpers/manifests/logs/metrics/exceptions) from `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/3B/artefact_registry_3B.yaml` per the clarified contract-vs-implementation boundary.
   - Verified the updated 3B registry YAML parses cleanly.

* 5:36am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to timestamp the crosscheck refresh.
   - Updated the 3B section in `docs/tmp/artefact_registry_crosscheck.md` to reflect the aligned dictionary/registry state (run reports, RNG logs, upstream inputs, and cross-layer bundles).
