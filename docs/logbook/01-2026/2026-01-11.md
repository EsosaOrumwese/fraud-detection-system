* 12:10am
   - Confirmed dev-mode contract source is docs/model_spec and committed to keep a switchable contract source for production.
   - Verified packages/engine is effectively empty and began bootstrapping the engine package from scratch.
   - Added core engine scaffolding (errors, logging, hashing, config, run-path resolution) to support run isolation and contract loading.
   - Added contract source + loader utilities for dictionary/registry/schema resolution.
   - Began Segment 1A S0 foundations: context structs, input resolution, hashing logic, RNG helpers, and S0 output writers.
   - Noted missing config file `config/layer1/1A/rng/run_seed.yaml` during S0 input checks (to be addressed in S0 implementation).

* 12:30am
   - Added contract-switching CLI/env support and implemented the first pass of Segment 1A S0 foundations (runner, path resolution, hashing, RNG anchor/audit/trace).
   - Created `config/layer1/1A/rng/run_seed.yaml` and wired seed loading with CLI override.
   - Implemented input resolution for S0 references, parameter file selection from registry templates, and manual schema checks for merchant_ids.
   - Added contract-derived output path resolution and run_id collision handling under runs/<run_id>.
   - Logged decisions in `segment_1A.impl_actual.md` per the implementation doctrine.
   - Chose manifest-fingerprint naming based on file basenames and documented the run-local staging limitation for S0.
