* 12:07am
   - Began 1A audit per the new audit-and-fix workflow (read the 1A guide order, artefact registry, and expanded S0 spec to establish authoritative inputs and invariants).
   - Inspected 1A S0 foundations runner to understand current parameter hash + manifest fingerprint inputs, run_id derivation, and output bundling paths.

* 12:14am
   - Audited 1A S0/S5/S6/S7 runtime paths and governance usage against specs and registries; noted mismatches in parameter_hash composition, output/validation bundle paths, RNG log paths, residual quantisation policy usage, S2 validation policy usage, and share-surface vintages (details reported to user).
