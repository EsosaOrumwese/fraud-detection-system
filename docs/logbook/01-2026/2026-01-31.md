* 04:05am
  - Fixed WSP MinIO stream reader: use `force_virtual_addressing=False` instead of unsupported `path_style_access` for PyArrow 19.

* 05:10am
  - WSP now normalizes ts_utc to RFC3339 micros with trailing Z to satisfy canonical envelope (fixes IG ENVELOPE_INVALID quarantines).

* 05:58am
  - Cleared Kinesis control/event bus streams, started IG service, and ran SR + WSP (max 200 events). WSP streamed 200 events successfully from MinIO stream view.
