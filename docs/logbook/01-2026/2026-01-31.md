### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 04:05am
  - Fixed WSP MinIO stream reader: use `force_virtual_addressing=False` instead of unsupported `path_style_access` for PyArrow 19.

* 05:10am
  - WSP now normalizes ts_utc to RFC3339 micros with trailing Z to satisfy canonical envelope (fixes IG ENVELOPE_INVALID quarantines).

* 05:58am
  - Cleared Kinesis control/event bus streams, started IG service, and ran SR + WSP (max 200 events). WSP streamed 200 events successfully from MinIO stream view.

* 06:05am
  - IG service targets now export PLATFORM_RUN_ID so receipts/health/quarantine land under the active run root.
  - IG admission logs now include receipt_ref + eb_ref for EB diagnostics.

* 06:21am
  - Ran fresh parity flow (new platform run id), streamed 20 events, IG receipts written under run-scoped prefix, platform log includes eb_ref lines.

* 06:30am
  - Normalized S3 run prefix: platform artifacts now written under `s3://fraud-platform/<run_id>/...` using `PLATFORM_STORE_ROOT`.
  - Ran fresh 20‑event parity flow; receipts + EB refs confirm in platform log.

* 07:00am
  - Reset LocalStack Kinesis streams, created a fresh platform run id, restarted IG after run creation, then ran SR → WSP (20‑event cap).
  - Verified IG receipts under `platform_20260131T065731Z/ig/receipts/` and confirmed EB has records in `fp-traffic-bus`.

* 07:09am
  - Updated Oracle Store, WSP, IG, and EB impl_actual + build_plan docs to mark v0 green and describe the current v0 posture.
  - Marked the platform Control & Ingress phase as v0 green with explicit meaning.

* 08:19am
  - Added EB diagnostics logging: `platform.log` now shows EB publish lines and a run‑scoped `eb/eb.log` is emitted.

* 08:27am
  - Ran a fresh parity run to demonstrate EB visibility: reset streams, SR READY published, WSP streamed 20 events, platform.log shows `IG published to EB ...`, and `runs/fraud-platform/<run_id>/event_bus/event_bus.log` contains EB publish diagnostics.

* 08:33am
  - Switched component log filenames/dirs from abbreviations to full names (`scenario_runner`, `world_streamer_producer`, `ingestion_gate`, `event_bus`).
