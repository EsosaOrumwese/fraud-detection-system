* 04:05am
  - Fixed WSP MinIO stream reader: use `force_virtual_addressing=False` instead of unsupported `path_style_access` for PyArrow 19.

* 05:10am
  - WSP now normalizes ts_utc to RFC3339 micros with trailing Z to satisfy canonical envelope (fixes IG ENVELOPE_INVALID quarantines).

* 05:58am
  - Cleared Kinesis control/event bus streams, started IG service, and ran SR + WSP (max 200 events). WSP streamed 200 events successfully from MinIO stream view.

* 06:05am
  - IG service targets now export PLATFORM_RUN_ID so receipts/health/quarantine land under the active run root.
  - IG admission logs now include receipt_ref + eb_ref for EB diagnostics.

* 06:21am
  - Ran fresh parity flow (new platform run id), streamed 20 events, IG receipts written under run-scoped prefix, platform log includes eb_ref lines.

* 06:30am
  - Normalized S3 run prefix: platform artifacts now written under `s3://fraud-platform/<run_id>/...` using `PLATFORM_STORE_ROOT`.
  - Ran fresh 20‑event parity flow; receipts + EB refs confirm in platform log.
