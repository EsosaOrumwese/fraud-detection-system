### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:11am
   - Expanded Layer-3 6A/6B business dataset schemas with concrete row-level fields (IDs, timestamps, hashes, fraud labels) and a hex64 reference for manifest/parameter hashes.
   - Synced updated schemas into both contract (`contracts/schemas/layer3/schemas.6A.yaml`, `contracts/schemas/layer3/schemas.6B.yaml`) and spec copies (`docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/schemas.6A.yaml`, `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/schemas.6B.yaml`).

* 12:31am
   - Read `AGENTS.md` and the required conceptual/narrative docs for layers 1-3 to align with project scope and determinism requirements.
   - Reviewed `docs/model_spec/data-engine/interface_pack/AGENTS.md` and noted the user request to focus on the interface pack and ignore `packages/engine` routing for context.
   - Scanned `docs/model_spec/data-engine/interface_pack` contents and reviewed `docs/model_spec/data-engine/interface_pack/README.md` for interface-pack scope and deliverables.

* 12:32am
   - Acknowledged the request to confirm understanding of the interface pack purpose and outlined the work scope at a high level (contracts, outputs/gates, and black-box boundaries).
