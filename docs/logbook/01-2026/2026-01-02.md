   - Expanded Layer-3 6A/6B business dataset schemas with concrete row-level fields (IDs, timestamps, hashes, fraud labels) and a hex64 reference for manifest/parameter hashes.
   - Synced updated schemas into both contract (`contracts/schemas/layer3/schemas.6A.yaml`, `contracts/schemas/layer3/schemas.6B.yaml`) and spec copies (`docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6A/schemas.6A.yaml`, `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-3/specs/contracts/6B/schemas.6B.yaml`).
