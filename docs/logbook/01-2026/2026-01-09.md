* 12:02am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` before formalizing the 2A merchant_mcc_map contract.
   - Reviewed the 2A data-intake guide, the 2A dictionary/registry, and the ingress schema pack to determine where to register `merchant_mcc_map`.
   - Planned to add a `merchant_mcc_map` schema anchor in `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml`, register it as optional reference_data in the 2A dictionary, and add a matching cross-layer pointer in the 2A registry.

* 12:05am
   - Added the `merchant_mcc_map` table schema to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml`.
   - Registered `merchant_mcc_map` as an optional ingress reference in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.2A.yaml` and added the matching cross-layer pointer to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2A/artefact_registry_2A.yaml`.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/2A/merchant_mcc_map_derivation-guide.md` and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/layer-1_data.md` to point at the new schema anchor.

* 12:06am
   - Ran a repository search to confirm `merchant_mcc_map` references now point at the new schema anchor across layer-1 specs.

* 12:13am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2A/state.2A.s2.expanded.md` to name `merchant_mcc_map` (schema `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml#/merchant_mcc_map`) as the optional MCC mapping anchor instead of a programme-specific placeholder.
