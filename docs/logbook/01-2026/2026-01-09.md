### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:02am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` before formalizing the 2A merchant_mcc_map contract.
   - Reviewed the 2A data-intake guide, the 2A dictionary/registry, and the ingress schema pack to determine where to register `merchant_mcc_map`.
   - Planned to add a `merchant_mcc_map` schema anchor in `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml`, register it as optional reference_data in the 2A dictionary, and add a matching cross-layer pointer in the 2A registry.

* 12:05am
   - Added the `merchant_mcc_map` table schema to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/1A/schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml`.
   - Registered `merchant_mcc_map` as an optional ingress reference in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2A/dataset_dictionary.layer1.2A.yaml` and added the matching cross-layer pointer to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2A/artefact_registry_2A.yaml`.
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/2A/merchant_mcc_map_derivation-guide.md` and `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/data-intake/layer-1_data.md` to point at the new schema anchor.

* 12:06am
   - Ran a repository search to confirm `merchant_mcc_map` references now point at the new schema anchor across layer-1 specs.

* 12:13am
   - Updated `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/state-flow/2A/state.2A.s2.expanded.md` to name `merchant_mcc_map` (schema `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml#/merchant_mcc_map`) as the optional MCC mapping anchor instead of a programme-specific placeholder.

* 12:17am
   - Read the 2B data-intake policy guides (alias_layout_policy_v1, day_effect_policy_v1, route_rng_policy_v1, virtual_edge_policy_v1) and compared them to `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml` to assess schema coverage.

* 12:19am
   - Recommended using `pad_byte_hex` as the canonical padding key and adopting a moderately strict schema posture (required keys + basic type/enum constraints, `extensions` allowed) for the 2B policy schemas.

* 12:22am
   - Added moderately strict schema shapes for `route_rng_policy_v1`, `alias_layout_policy_v1`, and `day_effect_policy_v1` in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/layer-1/specs/contracts/2B/schemas.2B.yaml`, keeping `extensions` as the expansion bucket.
   - Updated the 2B policy guides to reference schema anchors and aligned the alias layout padding key to `pad_byte_hex`.

* 12:23am
   - Sanity-checked 2B dictionary/registry policy schema refs and confirmed they point to the updated `schemas.2B.yaml#/policy/*` anchors.
