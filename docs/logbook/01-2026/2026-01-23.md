[2026-01-23 03:47] (local) interface_pack: completed full cross-check of engine_outputs.catalogue.yaml vs dataset dictionaries + schemas. Added  anchors to layer-3 schemas for 6A/6B gate + validation nodes to satisfy schema_ref pointers; reran cross-check: errors=0, warnings=2 (validation_bundle_6A/6B missing schema_ref). Report updated at docs/model_spec/data-engine/interface_pack/_harvest/interface_pack_crosscheck_report.json.

[2026-01-23 03:49] (local) interface_pack: added schema_ref for validation_bundle_6A/6B to point at validation_bundle_index anchors; cross-check now clean (errors=0, warnings=0).

[2026-01-23 03:52] (local) README: updated Data Engine status to implementation complete with final full-run validation in progress; refreshed build status table and spec-source notes.

[2026-01-23 03:55] (local) README/AGENTS: refreshed status to reflect implementation complete + full-run validation focus; added interface_pack pointers in README and black-box guidance in AGENTS.md.
