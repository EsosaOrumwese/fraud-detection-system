### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 5:34am
  - Added platform contracts index and aligned platform profiles to partitioning_profiles_v0.yaml.

* 5:37am
  - Added IG stream class to partitioning_profile_id mapping in config/platform/ig/README.md.

* 5:45am
  - Phase 1.4/1.5 audit: verified policy vs wiring separation, updated profile README, confirmed .env files are gitignored, and ran a filename-only secret marker scan.

* 5:52am
  - Marked Phase 1 complete and expanded Phase 2 into sections with DoD checklists in platform.build_plan.md.

* 5:56am
  - Marked SR v0 as ready to proceed to IG (path alignment follow‑up noted) in platform build plan and logged the decision.

* 6:07am
  - Started IG planning: added ingestion_gate.build_plan.md and ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md with Phase 1 breakdown and decision trail.

* 6:18am
  - IG Phase 1 implementation planning: documented push/pull ingestion assumption, component layout, planned files, contracts, and tests in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md.

* 7:19am
  - Began IG Phase 1 implementation execution: appended detailed decision trail and stepwise plan in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md (admission spine hardening + gate/instance checks + wiring alignment).

* 7:30am
  - Implemented IG Phase 1 hardening (admission flow fix, reason codes, gate + instance checks, wiring alignment, narrative logging) and added IG admission tests. Ran `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py -q` via venv; 3 passed after fixing receipt pin pruning.
  - Updated ingestion_gate.build_plan.md status to reflect Phase 1 in‑progress and remaining items.

* 7:39am
  - Added run joinability checks for push ingestion (SR READY + run_facts pin matching) and optional gate re‑hash verification when engine_root is configured. Added tests and marked IG Phase 1 complete in ingestion_gate.build_plan.md.

* 7:41am
  - Ran IG admission tests via venv: `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py -q`. Initial failure due to run‑scoped detection not triggered in test; fixed by allowing test class_map required pins override. Final result: 5 passed.

* 7:42am
  - Added fail‑fast guard: if `engine_root_path` is set and the gate verifier cannot be imported, IG build raises `GATE_VERIFIER_UNAVAILABLE`.

* 7:42am
  - Re-ran IG admission tests: `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py -q` → 5 passed.

* 7:50am
  - Expanded IG Phase 2 plan with sections + DoD, appended detailed Phase 2 planning entry (policy digesting, ops index, health/ingress control, observability) in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md, and marked Phase 2 planning in progress in ingestion_gate.build_plan.md.

* 7:54am
  - Started IG Phase 2 implementation: appended pre‑coding execution notes and hardening priorities in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md.

* 8:01am
  - Implemented Phase 2 hardening (policy digest + ops index + health probe + metrics + governance emitter + CLI lookups), updated build plan status, and recorded detailed decisions in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md. Ran tests: `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_ops_index.py -q` → 7 passed after adding audit profile to test partitioning fixtures.

* 8:12am
  - Began Phase 2 hardening round‑2 planning: EB health probes, rolling quarantine spikes, ops rebuild, telemetry tags, governance schemas (documented in ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md).

* 8:17am
  - Implemented Phase 2 hardening round‑2 (EB health thresholding, rolling quarantine spikes, ops rebuild + lookup, telemetry tags, governance schemas). Ran tests: `python -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_admission.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_ops_index.py tests/services/ingestion_gate/test_health_governance.py -q` → 10 passed. Marked Phase 2 complete in ingestion_gate.build_plan.md.

* 8:18am
  - Updated services/ingestion_gate/README.md with ops lookup, rebuild, and health CLI usage.

* 8:25am
  - Marked IG Phase 2 complete and started Phase 3 planning (replay/load/recovery) in ingestion_gate.build_plan.md and ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md.
