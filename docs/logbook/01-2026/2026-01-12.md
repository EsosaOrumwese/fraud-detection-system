# Logbook
### Date: 12th January 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 2:40am
   - Logged a detailed pre-implementation plan in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to close S6 spec gaps: rng_audit_log guard/append and counter-replay validation when log_all_candidates=false.

* 2:45am
   - Added S6 preflight audit-log guard: checks rng_audit_log for the run entry, appends one if missing (with git commit resolution), and fails in validate-only mode when missing.
   - Added counter-replay validation for existing gumbel_key logs: load existing events, enforce coverage rules for log_all_candidates vs selected-only, and fail on mismatches.
   - Added sanity checks for unexpected merchants or event-count mismatches when validating existing S6 outputs.

* 2:52am
   - Read S7 expanded spec and related contracts/policy files; logged a detailed pre-implementation plan + contract-gap list in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.

* 2:59am
   - Reorganized `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md` headers: removed placeholder sections, normalized state headers, and inserted S5/S7 headers so entries sit under the correct state.

* 3:18am
   - Logged S7 implementation kickoff decisions in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md`, covering policy registration/sealing, deterministic-only lane enforcement, membership/currency gating, and resumability behavior.

* 3:22am
   - Planned IEG conceptual doc updates per review: enforce envelope field MUSTs (no payload parsing), align watermark_basis keys to EB partition_id, define watermark offset meaning, pin deterministic update_semantics_id in update_key, clarify resolve_identity conflict posture, define deterministic ordering for list outputs, and fix event_time format.

* 3:28am
   - Updated IEG conceptual doc to enforce envelope MUSTs (no payload parsing; reject/quarantine on missing IG/Canonical Envelope fields), align graph_version watermark_basis keys to EB partition_id strings, and define watermark offsets as next_offset_to_apply (exclusive).
   - Pinned update_key to update_semantics_id constant (ieg_update_semantics_v0), added deterministic ordering rules for list outputs, and specified RFC3339/ISO8601 event_time format (including edge timestamps).
   - Clarified resolve_identity conflict posture (return all candidates with resolution_status) and updated examples/acceptance text accordingly.

* 4:14am
   - Logged an in-process S7 plan to finish runner logic, fix the policy schema placement in `schemas.layer1.yaml`, add CLI/Makefile wiring, and run S0-S7 after code updates.

* 4:32am
   - Implemented the S7 runner (deterministic integerisation, membership/gumbel fallback, gating, residual_rank + trace emission, resumability checks) and added the S7 CLI + Makefile target.
   - Fixed policy schema placement so `dp_score_print`/`per_currency` live under `policy/s6_selection` and S7 policy stays minimal.
   - Added `S7_INTEGERISATION_POLICY` to `SEG1A_PARAM_PAIRS` for preflight coverage and removed the temporary `test.tmp` file.

* 4:40am
   - Updated S0 hashing to treat `s7_integerisation_policy.yaml` as required so parameter_hash includes the new policy.
   - Adjusted S7 to scope merchants by `ztp_final` presence (eligible subset), aligned membership validation with the `membership` table schema, and fixed merchant_currency parsing.
   - Ran S0-S7 through the new run_id `42c3411f6b2e9b0a5d94c32f382ad2a3`; S7 completed and emitted residual_rank + trace rows.

* 4:41am
   - Corrected logbook placement by moving the 3:22am and 3:28am IEG entries from `docs/logbook/01-2026/2026-01-11.md` into this file.
## 2026-01-12 04:44:03
- Proceeding with IEG spec patch: add IEG4_query_surface_and_versioning.md, propagate conflict-resolution semantics and watermark basis rules, and append a ResolveIdentityResponse CONFLICT example to the conceptual doc; update logbook accordingly.
