### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 2:40am
   - Logged a detailed pre-implementation plan in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to close S6 spec gaps: rng_audit_log guard/append and counter-replay validation when log_all_candidates=false.

* 2:45am
   - Added S6 preflight audit-log guard: checks rng_audit_log for the run entry, appends one if missing (with git commit resolution), and fails in validate-only mode when missing.
   - Added counter-replay validation for existing gumbel_key logs: load existing events, enforce coverage rules for log_all_candidates vs selected-only, and fail on mismatches.
   - Added sanity checks for unexpected merchants or event-count mismatches when validating existing S6 outputs.

* 2:52am
   - Read S7 expanded spec and related contracts/policy files; logged a detailed pre-implementation plan + contract-gap list in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md`.

* 2:59am
   - Reorganized `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md` headers: removed placeholder sections, normalized state headers, and inserted S5/S7 headers so entries sit under the correct state.
