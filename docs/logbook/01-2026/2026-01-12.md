* 2:40am
   - Logged a detailed pre-implementation plan in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md` to close S6 spec gaps: rng_audit_log guard/append and counter-replay validation when log_all_candidates=false.

* 2:45am
   - Added S6 preflight audit-log guard: checks rng_audit_log for the run entry, appends one if missing (with git commit resolution), and fails in validate-only mode when missing.
   - Added counter-replay validation for existing gumbel_key logs: load existing events, enforce coverage rules for log_all_candidates vs selected-only, and fail on mismatches.
   - Added sanity checks for unexpected merchants or event-count mismatches when validating existing S6 outputs.
