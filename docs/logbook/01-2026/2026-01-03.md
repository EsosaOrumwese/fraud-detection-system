* 12:05am
   - Reviewed scenario_runner spec folder (README, scenario_runner.md) and contracts (run_facts_view, scenario_run_request, scenario_definition, run_status_event) for alignment with rails and engine interface pack.
   - Noted potential spec issues: contracts duplicate rails ID/timestamp/digest types instead of referencing rails contracts, README references a missing contracts/README.md, and several non-ASCII characters appear in README/scenario_runner.md section headings.

* 12:07am
   - Fixed 2A S0 merchant_mcc_map sourcing to prefer date-stamped parquet snapshots (e.g., 2025-12-31) over lexicographic "v" folders/CSV, so merchant_id space aligns with 1A/1B outputs.
   - Enforced Int64/Int32 typing when materialising merchant_mcc_map to match schema and avoid string IDs that caused zero virtual arrivals in 2B S6.
* 12:12am
   - Normalized non-ASCII characters in scenario_runner README and scenario_runner.md (quotes, dashes, arrows, section references) to ASCII-safe equivalents.
   - Added missing contracts/README.md listing scenario runner contract schemas.
