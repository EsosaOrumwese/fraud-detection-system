# Logbook
### Date: 30th January 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:24am
  - Updated run-first layout: EB file-bus now uses `.../<run_id>/eb`, WSP checkpoints under `.../<run_id>/wsp/checkpoints`, control-bus/run logs scoped to the platform run. Updated IG health path default, EB CLI default root, WSP config defaults, and local profile/README to match.

* 12:27am
  - Updated SR local wiring to omit `authority_store_dsn` so SR uses run-scoped `sr/index/sr_authority.db` by default.
  - Updated SR/WSP/IG tests to use explicit run prefixes and new run-scoped paths.

* 12:31am
  - Migrated existing artifacts from `runs/fraud-platform/{sr,ig,wsp,event_bus,control_bus,wsp_checkpoints}` into `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260129T201145Z/{sr,ig,wsp,eb,control_bus}`.
  - Moved legacy `platform_runs/<run_id>` logs into the run root; moved `ACTIVE_RUN_ID` to `runs/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID`.
  - Global platform log moved under the run root as `platform.log.global` (per-run log preserved).
  - NOTE: `runs/fraud-platform/platform_runs` remains as an empty directory; remove manually if desired.

* 12:37am
  - Removed `config/platform/profiles/dev_local.yaml` to eliminate mixed local filesystem + Kinesis semantics.
  - Promoted `local_parity.yaml` as the parity gate in README/profile docs; removed `IG_PROFILE_DEV` alias and updated EB build plan reference.

* 12:39am
  - Appended corrective notes across component impl_actuals (WSP/IG/Oracle/EB) to mark `dev_local` references as historical and to confirm `local_parity` is the parity gate profile.

* 12:41am
  - Added parity runbook `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md` with a 500k event walkthrough (Oracle → SR → WSP → IG → EB) and verification steps; linked it from `docs/README.md`.
