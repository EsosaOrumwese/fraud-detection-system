# Logbook
### Date: 30th January 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:24am
  - Updated run-first layout: EB file-bus now uses `.../<run_id>/eb`, WSP checkpoints under `.../<run_id>/wsp/checkpoints`, control-bus/run logs scoped to the platform run. Updated IG health path default, EB CLI default root, WSP config defaults, and local profile/README to match.

* 12:27am
  - Updated SR local wiring to omit `authority_store_dsn` so SR uses run-scoped `sr/index/sr_authority.db` by default.
  - Updated SR/WSP/IG tests to use explicit run prefixes and new run-scoped paths.

* 12:31am
  - Migrated existing artifacts from `runs/fraud-platform/{sr,ig,wsp,event_bus,control_bus,wsp_checkpoints}` into `runs/fraud-platform/platform_20260129T201145Z/{sr,ig,wsp,eb,control_bus}`.
  - Moved legacy `platform_runs/<run_id>` logs into the run root; moved `ACTIVE_RUN_ID` to `runs/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID`.
  - Global platform log moved under the run root as `platform.log.global` (per-run log preserved).
  - NOTE: `runs/fraud-platform/platform_runs` remains as an empty directory; remove manually if desired.

* 12:37am
  - Removed `config/platform/profiles/dev_local.yaml` to eliminate mixed local filesystem + Kinesis semantics.
  - Promoted `local_parity.yaml` as the parity gate in README/profile docs; removed `IG_PROFILE_DEV` alias and updated EB build plan reference.

* 12:39am
  - Appended corrective notes across component impl_actuals (WSP/IG/Oracle/EB) to mark `dev_local` references as historical and to confirm `local_parity` is the parity gate profile.

* 12:41am
  - Added parity runbook `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md` with a 500k event walkthrough (Oracle → SR → WSP → IG → EB) and verification steps; linked it from `docs/README.md`.

* 12:56am
  - Updated `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md` to explain what `platform-parity-bootstrap` does and added `platform-parity-stack-status` as a verification step.

* 01:03am
  - Updated `docs/runbooks/platform_parity_walkthrough_v0.md` to document `MANIFEST_MISMATCH` handling (fresh ORACLE_PACK_ROOT or strict‑seal check).

* 01:23am
  - Updated `.env.platform.local` to include MinIO `OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT/REGION` + `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET` defaults for oracle packing.
  - Updated parity runbook with required MinIO S3 envs (`OBJECT_STORE_*`, `AWS_*`) and `ORACLE_PACK_ROOT`, plus a note about boto credential fallbacks.

* 01:28am
  - Patched Makefile to export MinIO S3 env vars for oracle pack/check; updated parity runbook with endpoint export note.

* 01:29am
  - Updated parity runbook to add an explicit MinIO sync step for engine outputs and to set ORACLE_ROOT/ENGINE_RUN_ROOT to S3 paths for true parity.

* 01:33am
  - Rewrote the Oracle Store section of the parity runbook to a clear 4.1 sync + 4.2 seal flow; fixed section numbering after rewrite.

* 01:36am
  - Updated parity runbook: AWS CLI sync now prefixes MinIO credentials inline because `aws` does not read `.env.platform.local`.

* 02:19am
  - Updated `.env.platform.local` to use MinIO S3 Oracle Store paths (`ORACLE_ROOT`, `ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT`, `ORACLE_PACK_ROOT=pack_current`) so parity runs don’t require manual overrides.

* 02:23am
  - Added `platform-oracle-sync` Make target + `ORACLE_SYNC_SOURCE` so engine outputs can be synced into MinIO without manual AWS CLI env injection.
  - Updated parity Make targets to export MinIO creds for S3 access (LocalStack Kinesis still works), preventing 403s during IG parity startup.
  - Aligned `PARITY_ORACLE_ROOT` default to `ORACLE_ROOT` to keep the oracle root at bucket scope.
  - Updated parity runbook to use the new sync target and to document the MinIO‑backed Oracle flow.
