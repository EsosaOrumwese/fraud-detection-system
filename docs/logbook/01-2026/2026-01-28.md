### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 9:38am
  - Drafted WS design authority doc (`docs/model_spec/platform/component-specific/world_streamer.design-authority.md`) to pin role, boundaries, time semantics, and checkpoint truth.
  - Created WS implementation map with the live decision trail (`docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer.impl_actual.md`).

* 9:44am
  - Clarified platform-wide doc authority in AGENTS.md: blueprint + deployment notes are core; other platform-wide docs are guardrail supplements.

* 9:52am
  - Added oracle storage + engine interface boundary section to WSP design authority (env ladder + explicit non‑replacement of interface pack).

* 12:52pm
  - Updated platform design-authority docs to make WSP push ingestion the primary runtime path and tag engine-pull as legacy/backfill (IG, IEG, WSP, platform-wide notes).
  - Normalized remaining “engine pull” references to “legacy engine pull” where they describe optional/backfill paths.

* 1:10pm
  - Revamped platform build plan to insert Oracle Store + WSP as Phase 2 and shift Control & Ingress alignment to Phase 3 (WSP-first runtime truth).
  - Logged the decision trail in platform.impl_actual for Oracle Store + WSP sequencing and speedup-factor policy knob.

* 1:18pm
  - Created Oracle Store design authority and build plan; added Oracle Store implementation map with initial decision trail.
  - Added WSP build plan and appended WSP implementation map entry for Phase 2 kickoff (oracle_root + speedup policy).
