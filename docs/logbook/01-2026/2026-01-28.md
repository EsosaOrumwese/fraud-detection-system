### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 9:38am
  - Drafted WS design authority doc (`docs/model_spec/platform/component-specific/world_streamer.design-authority.md`) to pin role, boundaries, time semantics, and checkpoint truth.
  - Created WS implementation map with the live decision trail (`docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer.impl_actual.md`).

* 9:44am
  - Clarified platform-wide doc authority in AGENTS.md: blueprint + deployment notes are core; other platform-wide docs are guardrail supplements.

* 9:52am
  - Added oracle storage + engine interface boundary section to WSP design authority (env ladder + explicit non‑replacement of interface pack).

* 12:52pm
  - Updated platform design-authority docs to make WSP push ingestion the primary runtime path and tag engine-pull as legacy/backfill (IG, IEG, WSP, platform-wide notes).
  - Normalized remaining “engine pull” references to “legacy engine pull” where they describe optional/backfill paths.

* 1:10pm
  - Revamped platform build plan to insert Oracle Store + WSP as Phase 2 and shift Control & Ingress alignment to Phase 3 (WSP-first runtime truth).
  - Logged the decision trail in platform.impl_actual for Oracle Store + WSP sequencing and speedup-factor policy knob.

* 1:18pm
  - Created Oracle Store design authority and build plan; added Oracle Store implementation map with initial decision trail.
  - Added WSP build plan and appended WSP implementation map entry for Phase 2 kickoff (oracle_root + speedup policy).

* 1:38pm
  - Wired Oracle Store + WSP fields into platform profiles (stream_speedup, oracle_root, ig_ingest_url) and documented in profiles README.
  - Added WSP package scaffold (config, control bus, runner, CLI) and Makefile target for a one‑shot READY smoke path.

* 2:37pm
  - Updated Oracle Store design authority with v0 transitional notes (pack‑root aliasing + local seal allowance).
  - Implemented Oracle Store checker + CLI + Make target for run_facts_view validation and locator/gate checks.

* 2:38pm
  - Ran Oracle Store check on run_facts_view `9142f6d3ed4ca6375f388946e0e4ea4d` (local) → WARN due to missing seal marker; locators and required gates passed.

* 2:45pm
  - Expanded Oracle Store build plan to include implementation + hardening phases (checker, strict‑seal, S3 validation, seal tooling, governance posture).

* 2:51pm
  - Hardened Oracle Store checker with stable reason codes and strict‑seal defaults for dev/prod; added S3 path validation tests.

* 2:52pm
  - Ran Oracle Store unit tests: `pytest tests/services/oracle_store/test_checker.py -q` → 4 passed.

* 2:54pm
  - Ran Oracle Store hardened check (dev_local + strict-seal) on run_facts_view `9142f6d3ed4ca6375f388946e0e4ea4d` → FAIL (PACK_NOT_SEALED).

* 2:57pm
  - Expanded Oracle Store Phase 3 plan (seal/manifest tooling + pack identity schema + local pack sealing helper) and recorded decision trail in oracle_store.impl_actual.

* 3:06pm
  - Implemented Oracle packer + seal CLI, added packer tests, and updated checker to report manifest metadata + missing manifest warnings.

* 3:08pm
  - Fixed packer idempotency (ignore timestamp mismatch), sealed the local pack root for run_facts_view `9142f6d3ed4ca6375f388946e0e4ea4d`, and re-ran strict‑seal check (dev_local) → OK.
  - Ran oracle_store tests: `pytest tests/services/oracle_store/test_checker.py tests/services/oracle_store/test_packer.py -q` → 6 passed.

* 3:10pm
  - Added Oracle pack manifest/seal schemas and validation; strict‑seal dev check remains OK after schema validation.

* 3:14pm
  - Added strict Make target for oracle checks and a short operator guide in the Oracle Store design authority.

* 3:26pm
  - Documented platform runtime log + run-id locations in `docs/README.md` to keep the operational paths discoverable.

* 3:46pm
  - Appended **IMPORTANT** boundary notes to oracle_store, world_streamer_producer, and platform impl_actual maps: Oracle Store is external engine truth; WSP reads it; `runs/fraud-platform` is platform runtime only.

* 4:17pm
  - Removed SR‑based Oracle Store sealing; rebuilt checker + packer to operate directly on engine run roots; added engine‑rooted pack CLI and new Make targets.
  - Updated Oracle Store operator guide + build plan to remove run_facts_view usage and document engine‑rooted flow; adjusted tests accordingly.

* 4:19pm
  - Ran Oracle Store tests: `pytest tests/services/oracle_store/test_checker.py tests/services/oracle_store/test_packer.py -q` → 6 passed.

* 4:23pm
  - Added a pack‑from‑engine quick guide with default paths (local + future) to the Oracle Store design authority.

* 4:25pm
  - Added a dev cutover checklist for Oracle Store (engine world → pack → strict check → WSP/IG smoke).

* 4:36pm
  - Planned WSP rewire to be engine‑rooted (oracle‑rooted, no SR join‑surface dependency) with explicit inputs, gate checks, output selection, and tests.

* 5:07pm
  - Implemented engine‑rooted WSP Phase 1 (policy allowlist, engine run root wiring, gate checks, pack/manifest checks, engine‑rooted CLI/Make target).
  - Added WSP tests for engine‑rooted streaming + missing gate failure; ran `pytest tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py -q` → 2 passed.

* 5:09pm
  - Updated WSP build plan to reflect the engine‑rooted (Oracle Store) flow and remove READY/run_facts_view assumptions.

* 6:38pm
  - Added Phase 2 planning entry for WSP (checkpointing + resume) with explicit non‑conflation with validation (Phase 4).

* 6:40pm
  - Expanded WSP build plan Phase 2 sections (checkpoint identity, backends, resume semantics).
