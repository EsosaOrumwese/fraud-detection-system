* 9:38am
  - Drafted WS design authority doc (`docs/model_spec/platform/component-specific/world_streamer.design-authority.md`) to pin role, boundaries, time semantics, and checkpoint truth.
  - Created WS implementation map with the live decision trail (`docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer.impl_actual.md`).

* 9:44am
  - Clarified platform-wide doc authority in AGENTS.md: blueprint + deployment notes are core; other platform-wide docs are guardrail supplements.

* 9:52am
  - Added oracle storage + engine interface boundary section to WSP design authority (env ladder + explicit non‑replacement of interface pack).
