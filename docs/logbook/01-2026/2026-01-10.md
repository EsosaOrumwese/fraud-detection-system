* 12:09am
   - Added validation_bundle_index_{1A,1B} to the S9 Contract Card outputs in the 1A and 1B state-expanded specs.
   - Updated 2A.S5 cross-references and Contract Card outputs to include validation_bundle_index_2A and clarified catalogue/registry coverage.

* 12:13am
   - Ran a Contract Card + Cross-Layer Inputs consistency sweep against contract dictionary/registry IDs (filtered to bullet-listed IDs in those sections).
   - Result: no mismatches found after accounting for dotted IDs (e.g., policy and static file identifiers).
* 12:18am
   - Updated interface_pack path tokens to use manifest_fingerprint={manifest_fingerprint} for fingerprint-scoped paths to align with contracts.
   - Added s0_gate_receipt_1A and validation_bundle_index_{1A,1B,2A} to engine_outputs.catalogue.yaml and dataset_outputs.json; synced partitioning keys to manifest_fingerprint.
   - Updated engine_gates.map.yaml to emit s0_gate_receipt_1A.
* 12:33am
   - Regenerated interface_pack harvest output dataset list from all dataset dictionaries (skipping reports/ paths) into interface_pack/_harvest/dataset_outputs.json.
* 12:42am
   - Regenerated interface_pack engine_outputs.catalogue.yaml and engine_gates.map.yaml from the refreshed harvest to keep outputs and gates in lockstep.
* 12:44am
   - Ran a harvest-vs-interface_pack integrity check (outputs + gates).
   - Findings: no missing/extra output IDs, but RNG log paths/schemas differ across segments and validation_bundle_1B shows a duplicate schema_ref mismatch from cross-layer definitions.
* 1:02am
   - Noted user directive to discard the attempted spec-side normalization; keep contracts as source of truth and avoid interface_pack-led changes.
* 1:13am
   - Regenerated interface_pack harvest from contract dictionaries (datasets/logs/reports/policies/artefacts) without filtering produced_by; duplicates preserved.
   - Regenerated engine_outputs.catalogue.yaml and engine_gates.map.yaml from that harvest baseline.
   - Added tools/interface_pack_integrity_check.py and verified the interface pack matches the harvest baseline with zero mismatches.
