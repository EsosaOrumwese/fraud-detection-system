### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:47am
   - Recorded approved S2 confirmation decisions: strict MCC gating (abort without sealed mapping), tz_world membership hard-fail for final tzid, and override_no_effect hard-fail.
   - Logged these decisions in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md` before coding.

* 01:06am
   - Began S2 implementation: created `seg_2A/s2_overrides` package stub and recorded a detailed implementation-start entry in `segment_2A.impl_actual.md`.
   - Preparing S2 runner/CLI/Makefile wiring to follow the approved strict validator posture.

* 01:32am
   - Implemented the S2 overrides runner (validations, override precedence, tzid domain + tz_world membership, coverage checks, deterministic `created_utc`, atomic publish).
   - Added S2 CLI entry point and Makefile wiring (`segment2a-s2` target + args).
   - Logged the detailed implementation steps in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_2A.impl_actual.md`.

* 01:39am
   - Diagnosed S2 runtime faults: Polars geoarrow extension panic when reading `tz_world.parquet`, and `2A-S2-055` override-no-effect triggered by the RS country override.
   - Implemented pyarrow-based tzid set loading to avoid geoarrow extension decoding.
   - Logged the override-no-effect conflict and flagged the policy decision needed in `segment_2A.impl_actual.md`.
