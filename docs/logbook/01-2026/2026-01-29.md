* 12:32am
  - Pruned legacy IG pull/READY Make targets per request (streaming‑only entrypoints remain).

* 12:36am
  - Normalized today’s logbook header to match the standard format used in prior days.

* 12:40am
  - Planned IG Phase 9 validation (push‑only): defined acceptance criteria, local smoke steps, and config enforcement checks in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/ingestion_gate.impl_actual.md`.

* 12:45am
  - Ran IG Phase 9 push‑only tests: `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests/services/ingestion_gate -q` → 16 passed, 1 skipped (Werkzeug deprecation warnings).

* 1:08am
  - Planned WSP READY consumer runner so SR can drive WSP automatically; documented design intent, idempotency strategy, and test plan in `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/world_streamer_producer.impl_actual.md`.

* 1:11am
  - Implemented WSP READY consumer runner (file‑bus): reads READY + run_facts_view, resolves scenario_id + engine_run_root, streams via WSP, and appends READY run records.
  - Added Make targets for READY consumer and unit tests for READY handling + duplicate skip.

* 1:12am
  - Fixed READY consumer tests (created temp object-store root before writing allowlist).
  - Re‑ran WSP tests: `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_ready_consumer.py tests/services/world_streamer_producer/test_runner.py -q` → 6 passed.
