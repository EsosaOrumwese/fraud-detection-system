### Date: 7th January 2026
### Project: Fraud Detection System
### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 8:39am
   - Checked the local system time with `Get-Date` to anchor the logbook entry.
   - Listed `docs/logbook/01-2026` to confirm no existing 2026-01-07 logbook file.
   - Reviewed `docs/logbook/01-2026/2026-01-04.md` to match the established log format.
   - Decided to draft a response that names and frames the requested spec-to-operation document (implementation interpretation/operational narrative), outlines a practical template, and asks clarifying questions about scope, depth, and review workflow.

* 8:41am
   - Chose to recommend a segment-first readback with per-state subsections, a dedicated `docs/implementation_readbacks` location, and prose + minimal pseudocode/flow diagrams to balance reviewability with fidelity.

* 8:45am
   - Checked local time with `Get-Date` before drafting the template.
   - Created `docs/implementation_readbacks/` as the new home for execution walkthroughs.
   - Added `docs/implementation_readbacks/README.md` to lock the purpose, authority, and format decisions.
   - Added `docs/implementation_readbacks/template.segment.md` as the starter template for segment walkthroughs.

* 8:53am
   - Reviewed `scratch_files/scratch.md` to capture the refined intent for execution walkthroughs.
   - Read the required conceptual and layer narratives (closed-world enterprise design, Layer-1/2/3 narratives) before modifying docs.
   - Updated `docs/implementation_readbacks/README.md` to reflect the execution spine workflow, explicit gap labeling, and review gate.
   - Replaced `docs/implementation_readbacks/template.segment.md` with a step-wise execution spine template aligned to the new intent.

* 8:57am
   - Chose to endorse the execution spine + step expansion workflow from `scratch_files/scratch.md` as the preferred implementer-facing format because it forces run-order clarity, surfaces gaps early, and prevents narrative drift.

* 9:00am
   - Logged the user's preference for detailed walkthroughs with no length limits.
   - Updated `docs/implementation_readbacks/README.md` to explicitly encourage detailed expansions without length caps.
   - Updated `docs/implementation_readbacks/template.segment.md` to request detailed step procedures and note the lack of length limits.

* 9:05am
   - Reviewed `scratch_files/scratch.md` to confirm the requested "bridge" intent for 1A.
   - Read the 1A state-flow overview and dataset dictionary to align spec expectations with implementation artifacts.
   - Inspected the 1A orchestrator and S0/S1/S2 runners to ground the example walkthrough in actual code behavior.
   - Decided to respond with a focused bridge excerpt (execution spine + expanded S0-S2) highlighting specific spec-to-code confusion points without editing docs.

* 9:08am
   - Reviewed the updated `scratch_files/scratch.md` guidance on execution spines and step narratives (no inline spec refs, no bucket sections).
   - Decided to confirm that the walkthrough format should be step-based with procedures + explicit gaps, and to offer a template adjustment if requested.

* 9:10am
   - Updated `docs/implementation_readbacks/README.md` to enforce no bucket checklists and no inline spec references in the main body.
   - Updated `docs/implementation_readbacks/template.segment.md` to the "execution spine + step narratives" format with procedure + gaps only and optional inline tags.
