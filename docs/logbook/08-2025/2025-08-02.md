### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:35am
  * Added missing implied artefacts to 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B.
  * Fix issues (quality rating)
    * 3A: 92–94% -- fix site-catalog wiring; complete licensing; propagate the allocation manifest downstream. 
    * 3B: 89–91% -- fix site-catalog wiring; don’t mutate 1B output (use overlay or v2); add schema/specs, licensing, γ-audit, and civil-time provenance. 
    * 4A: 94–96% -- expand build-manifest dependencies to include all segment manifests; add read-only cross-layer inputs used by harnesses. 
    * 4B: 91–93% -- add site-catalog input; include `civil_time_manifest`; register adversarial model (or governed head), RNG policy, and licence bundle.

* 1:10am
  * All consumers of location data (3A, 3B, 4B) now read the single authoritative 1B egress with its schema; no more `outlet_catalogue/outlet_stub.avsc` drift. 
  * Civil-time lineage flows forward: 3B’s `virtual_manifest` and 4B’s `validator_manifest` now include 2A’s `civil_time_manifest` digest. 
  * 4A’s `build_manifest` rolls up segment manifests (1B/2A/2B/3A/3B), so a single hash proves the end-to-end universe that generated current artefacts. 
  * Licences are governed for 3A/3B via explicit `LICENSES/` entries, matching the pattern we established in 1B/2B.
