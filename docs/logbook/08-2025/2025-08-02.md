### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:35am
  * Added missing implied artefacts to 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B.
  * Fix issues (quality rating)
    * 3A: 92–94% -- fix site-catalog wiring; complete licensing; propagate the allocation manifest downstream. 
    * 3B: 89–91% -- fix site-catalog wiring; don’t mutate 1B output (use overlay or v2); add schema/specs, licensing, γ-audit, and civil-time provenance. 
    * 4A: 94–96% -- expand build-manifest dependencies to include all segment manifests; add read-only cross-layer inputs used by harnesses. 
    * 4B: 91–93% -- add site-catalog input; include `civil_time_manifest`; register adversarial model (or governed head), RNG policy, and licence bundle.

* 1:10am
  * All consumers of location data (3A, 3B, 4B) now read the single authoritative 1B egress with its schema; no more `outlet_catalogue/outlet_stub.avsc` drift. 
  * Civil-time lineage flows forward: 3B’s `virtual_manifest` and 4B’s `validator_manifest` now include 2A’s `civil_time_manifest` digest. 
  * 4A’s `build_manifest` rolls up segment manifests (1B/2A/2B/3A/3B), so a single hash proves the end-to-end universe that generated current artefacts. 
  * Licences are governed for 3A/3B via explicit `LICENSES/` entries, matching the pattern we established in 1B/2B.

* 4:47pm
  * Worked on fixing the issues with 1A-4B. Summary of net impact:
    * Closes the only dangling cross-layer reference by making 2A emit `zoneinfo_digest` expected by 4B.
    * Pins all validator “engine parts” (firewall, barcode, semantic GLM, reproducer) so 4B manifests fully bind code and configs named in the narrative.
    * Aligns the transaction schema with dual-TZ semantics, virtual IP fields, and DST flags that the validator and router actually use.
    * Created a registry lock. Added a single artefact that materialises the layer freeze (list of all registry YAMLs + their SHA-256, plus the cross-layer digests you care about)

* 11:33pm
  * Finally iron out all issues with my schema. Based on multiple scans, there's nothing wrong with it and I'll hold it as "truth" (well upgradeable) for the next sections of this project.
