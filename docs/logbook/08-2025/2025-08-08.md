### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 8:16am
  * Began working on the data-dictionary for subsegment 1A
  * Deleted deprecated contracts: `build_repro/`, `edge_case/`, `interface_contract/`, `parameter_prior_posterior/` and `version_matrix/`.
  * Decide to move from a folder structure for each contract to one for each subsegment. Example but not authoritative:
    ```text
    /contracts/1A/
      artefact_registry
      schema_ingress.1A.json
      schema_egress.1A.json
      invariants.1A.yaml
      rng_contract.1A.yaml
      logging_contract.1A.yaml
      performance.1A.yaml
      interface_contract.1A.yaml   # assembled from the above
    ```
