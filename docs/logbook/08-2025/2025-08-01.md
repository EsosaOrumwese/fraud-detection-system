### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 11:08pm
  * Final pass on the artefact registry to close all the holes that exist before working on the data dictionary.
  * Fix issues (quality rating)
    * 1A: 95–97% -- mostly licensing polish and consistency flags. 
    * 1B: 92–94% -- strong spatial pipeline; add write-governance artefacts, fill the roads suite, tighten licences. 
    * 2A: 90–93% -- excellent timezone coverage; fix the site-catalogue path and add licence bundle. 
    * 2B: 92–94% -- core routing ready; correct input path, add error/buffer/licences to the manifest.
  * Cross layer checks:
    * 1A->1B: make 1B’s `spatial_manifest.json` digest a declared dependency of 1A’s `manifest_fingerprint` (read-only), so any spatial change forces a new 1A fingerprint and prevents silent reuse. 
    * 1B->2A: require `tz_world_metadata.json` and `tzid_insertion_order.txt` digests in any 1B timezone-related event (`tz_resample`, mismatch events). 
    * 2A->2B: insist 2B’s routing manifest embeds `civil_time_manifest` digest; refuse to run if they differ. 
  * Correct cross-layer wiring: 2A and 2B now read the right 1B artefact (`site_catalogue`) and schema, removing a subtle but critical mismatch. 
  * Provenance continuity: 2B’s `routing_manifest` now depends on 2A’s `civil_time_manifest`, so TZ lineage is visible in routing builds. 
  * Licence lineage: All four subsegments expose `LICENSES/` as governed inputs, matching your governing appendices and 4A rules.
