* 11:08pm
  * Final pass on the artefact registry to close all the holes that exist before working on the data dictionary.
  * Fix issues
    * Correct cross-layer wiring: 2A and 2B now read the right 1B artefact (`site_catalogue`) and schema, removing a subtle but critical mismatch. 
    * Provenance continuity: 2B’s `routing_manifest` now depends on 2A’s `civil_time_manifest`, so TZ lineage is visible in routing builds. 
    * Licence lineage: All four subsegments expose `LICENSES/` as governed inputs, matching your governing appendices and 4A rules.
