### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 5:47am
  * Update the `state-flow-overview.txt`

* 7:38am
  * Finalize spec + lineage; pin Poisson; add crossborder_features; deterministic country_set; gate 1B hand-off; registry/dictionary consistency
  * Close the remaining algorithmic and governance gaps in Subsegment 1A (Merchants → Physical Sites) and align the state-flow, schemas, registry, and dataset dictionary. This commit:
    - Pins Poisson(λ) sampling (S0.3.7: inversion for small λ, PTRS for large λ) with normative constants and draw-accounting.
    - Introduces `crossborder_features` (parameter-scoped, produced in S0) for the openness scalar X_m and wires it into S4.
    - Makes `country_set` persistence **deterministic** for domestic-only and K* = 0 paths; S6 is the sole writer (home row rank=0 always present).
    - Enforces the 1B **hand-off gate**: consumers must verify `_passed.flag == SHA256(validation_bundle_1A)` for the same fingerprint and join `country_set.rank` for inter-country order.
    - Normalizes `ranking_residual_cache_1A` paths and clarifies partitioning for randomness-bearing datasets.
    - Cleans up the artefact registry to point RNG event schemas at authoritative JSON-Schema anchors and fixes dependency aliases.
