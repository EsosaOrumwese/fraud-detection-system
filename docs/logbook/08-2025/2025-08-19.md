### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 1:45am
  * Fixed the PRNG state & envelope (shape, counters, draws) and Substream derivation & IDs issues in expanded state 0 doc.
  * Fixed the Uniform mapping & transforms, Normal (Box–Muller) and Gamma (Marsaglia–Tsang) issues in expanded state 0 doc

* 2:12am
  * Fixed the Poisson & ZTP, Logging, partitions, lineage and Numeric environment & cross-references issues in expanded state 0 doc.

* 6:44am
  * Still ironing out all the errors and ambiguities in the state 0's spec so we can freeze it

* 6:56am
  * Frozen `state.1A.s0.expanded.md` will soon deprecate `state.1A.s0.md` as its outdated and obsolete.

* 9:35am
  * Tighten determinism and fix minor inconsistencies in RNG and summary.
  * Summary:
    - Make U(0,1) mapping strictly open in §S0.3.4 by guarding the single endpoint
      (x = 2^64−1) to ONE_MINUS_EPS; update note to reflect exact 2^-64 literal.
    - Correct Gamma(α<1) budget in §S0.3.6 reference pseudocode (remove stray “+ 2”).
    - Echo tertiary tie-break for Gumbel keys in §S0.3.8 summary: (ISO asc, merchant_id asc).
    - Clarify serialization in §S0.3.1: JSON carries numeric values; endianness applies only to derivation.
    - Add `lgamma` to deterministic libm set in §S0.8.2 and example manifest.

  Rationale:
  These edits remove the last sources of ambiguity without changing intended semantics,
  preserving the frozen design while making implementer behavior deterministic across toolchains.
