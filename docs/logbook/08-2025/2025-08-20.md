### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 5:27am
  * add spec-true pseudocode primitives (L0) for State 0
    * Source of truth: `state.1A.s0.expanded.md` (frozen S0).
    * Scope: language-agnostic, zero-initiative algorithms; no new artefacts introduced.

* 7:12pm
  * Began working on fleshing out the sub-routines within the subsections of state-0 (L1)

* 11:06pm
  * Finished working on L1 for pseudocode algorithms for the sections within state-0 of 1A
  * Update pseudocodes for L1 of s0-1A by linting out stray reference markers and aligning with primitives in L0
