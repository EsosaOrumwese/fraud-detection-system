* 3:06am
  * S1: align envelope budget with S0; finalize B11–B15
    - Restore S0-required envelope fields `blocks` (int) and `draws` (JSON base-10 uint128).
    - State and enforce equalities: `u128(after)-u128(before) == blocks == parse_u128(draws) == trace_draws == draws_expected`.
    - Keep single-budget primitive `d_m` for math; for hurdle, `blocks = d_m ∈ {0,1}`.
    - Validator V5 updated to check `delta==blocks` and reconcile envelope/trace.
    - Error payloads: rename `draws_observed` → `trace_draws`.
    - No change to downstream semantics; no optional stream_jump in normative text.
