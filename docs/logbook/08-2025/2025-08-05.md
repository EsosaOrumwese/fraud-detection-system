* 3:14pm
  * Past few days have been spent reading the narrative and understanding the design to find out what's expected and if there are any design holes.
  * Found out that the design requires a few artefacts ready before beginning in subsegment 1A: `hurdle_coefficients.yaml`, `nb_dispersion_coefficients.yaml` and `crossborder_hyperparams.yaml` together with other publicly available datasets.
  * The above are crucial because they are coefficients derived from a trained model on historical data and as such these models and their coefficients need to be put in place for the smooth operation of the engine.
  * In that regard, as I was fleshing out the technical documentation for obtaining the `crossborder_hyperparams.yaml`, we edited (without any major change to the functionality) the link function of the Zero Truncated Poison model used in 1A from the identity link function (λ = θ₀ + θ₁ log N) to the log link function (λ = exp(θ₀ + θ₁ X))

    | **Assumptions 1A** (original design note) | **Identity** λ = θ₀ + θ₁ log N  | θ₀ + θ₁ log N                     | Must keep λ > 0 by constraining θ’s and N; identity link was chosen for its simple closed-form expectation shown in the doc. |
    | **Current technical plan**                | **Log link** λ = exp(θ₀ + θ₁ X) | θ₀ + θ₁ X with X = openness index | Standard GLM practice; automatically enforces λ > 0, works with HC3 s.e. & bootstrap code you’ve specified.                  |
