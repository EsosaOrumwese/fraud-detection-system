### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 7:20am
  * Add an explicit derivation step for merchant currency
  * Clarified two friction points regarding policy on retry-exhaustion and K vs. candidate size M 
    * (i) what happens after 64 rejections in ZTP, and 
    * (ii) what if $K$ exceeds the number of available foreign candidates $M$. 

* 8:01am
  * Make currency->country expansion pipeline fully explicit
    - Replaced S5.2–S5.3 with tightened definitions of α=0.5, T=30, destination-level vs. global sparsity.
    - Explicit guard: require w_i > 0; abort on violation.
    - Detailed renormalisation policy: binary64 serial summation over ISO-sorted indices; tolerance 1e-12.
    - Clarified smoothing vs. raw vs. equal-split fallback conditions; preserved schema compatibility.
    - Added note in S5.4 that no schema changes are required; persistence maps to existing ccy_country_weights_cache and sparse_flag tables.

* 8:21am
  * Make Gumbel-top-k selection numerically explicit
