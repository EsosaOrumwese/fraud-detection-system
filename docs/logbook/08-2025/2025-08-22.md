* 12:31am
  * Began working on the L2-Orchestrator document for the routines and primitives of state-0. 
    * Essence is to make sure that this sets of docs serve as truth and clear specification when it's time for implementation
    * And also the other per sub-segment contracts will be drawn off all of these.

* 12:35pm
  * Finished working on v1 of the L2-orchestrator.

* 2:46pm
  * Sorted out the issues with L2-orchestrator. It now agrees with L0 and L1 and the state-flow for state 0.
  * Resolve the stray argument in L1-`compute_manifest_fingerprint` which called `parameter_hash_hex`. 
    * Removed it from reqd args in function and replaced its `mf_resolved` output with `hex64(param_b32)`

* 5:08pm
  * Began working on L3, the validation section for state-0.

* 5:54pm
  * Committed v1 of L3 now working on ironing out all issues before freezing it
