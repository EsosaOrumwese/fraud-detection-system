### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 12:03pm
  * Still wrestling to see how I can implement `great_expectations`. ChatGPT has no clue what it's doing at all.
  * Decided to go through the [documentation](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/introduction/) and try to at least implement a skeleton version
    * _expectation_: A declarative assertion about your data.
    * _suite_: A named collection of related Expectations.
    * _data context_: The project root for GE—holds configs, data sources, suites, and docs.
    * _checkpoint_: A runnable artifact that bundles one or more suites against one or more data sources.
    * _data docs_: Automatically generated HTML reports showing which Expectations passed or failed, with sample rows and metrics.

* 1:02pm
  * Decided to build using step by step in a jupyter notebook before transferring to the `.py` file

* 2:34pm
  * Great Expectations is finally working!!! I can't test it properly as I don't have any data however, running it on the empty df seemed to work.
  * Resources to have a look at:
    * https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/reference/learn/migration_guide/?pandas_filesystem_creation=v1_pandas_filesystem_creation
    * https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/reference/api/data_context/FileDataContext_class?utm_source=chatgpt.com
    * https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/connect_to_data/dataframes?procedure=sample_code

* 3:12pm
  * Sorted out scripts for great expectation and confirmed `ge_bootstrap` to be working locally.
  * Currently making a script to generate an empty parquet file to run a smoke test on `ge_validate` locally as well as on the CI

* 6:23pm
  * Diagnosed and corrected “Fixture ‘spec’ called directly” error by moving parametrization inside tests or using module‐level variables.
  * Updated `scripts/schema_to_md.py` to read YAML with `utf-8-sig`, reconfigure `stdout` for UTF-8, escape `|` in descriptions, and optionally replace em-dash.
  * Enhanced `scripts/schema_to_json.py` to:
    * Represent `nullable` via `type: [base, "null"]`
    * Carry over `description`
    * Add `additionalProperties: False`
    * Write UTF-8 explicitly 
  * Created `scripts/bump_schema_version.py` and Makefile target for `patch|minor|major` bumps, auto-committing and tagging. 
  * ~~Built `src/frauddetection/features/mcc.py` lazy-loader, discussed sourcing `mcc_lookup.csv` from card networks or community CSV.~~
  * Added a pre-commit entry to validate `transaction_schema.yaml` against the generated `transaction_schema.json`, fixed `files:` regex and CLI args.
  * Walked through GE core concepts (Expectations, Suites, Data Context, DataDocs, Checkpoints).
  * Clarified difference between GE and pytest for data-contract enforcement.
  * Authored `scripts/ge_bootstrap.py` using GE 1.4.5 V1 API:
    * Load YAML spec
    * `get_context(...)` → new FileDataContext
    * Create fresh `ExpectationSuite` via `ctx.suites.add(...)`
    * Map YAML dtypes → Python types & add `ExpectColumnToExist`, `ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull`, `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType`, `ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet`
  * Wrote `scripts/gen_dummy_parquet.py` to emit a one-row Parquet with valid placeholder values—so non-null & type checks pass.
  * Built `scripts/ge_validate.py` using V1 ValidationDefinition API:
    * Register in‐memory Pandas DataFrame asset (`add_pandas` → `add_dataframe_asset` → `add_batch_definition_whole_dataframe`)
    * Idempotently fetch or add a `ValidationDefinition`
    * Run `vd.run(batch_parameters={"dataframe": df})` and exit `0|1`
  * Updated Makefile to invoke `poetry run python scripts/...` (cross-platform), set `FILE ?=…` globally, and add `smoke-schema` target that bootstraps, generates dummy data, and validates.
  * Enhanced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include a `data-quality` job that runs `make ge-bootstrap`, `make gen-empty-parquet`, and `make ge-validate FILE=tmp/empty.parquet`.
