* 5:21am
   - Updated the governance artefacts so S0’s loaders now accept them. Added the mandatory numeric-policy switches (`binary_format`, `rounding_mode`, `fma_allowed`, etc.) and kept the existing merchant/GDP/channel thresholds (`reference/governance/numeric_policy/2025-10-07/numeric_policy.json`). 
   - Added a proper artifacts array with SHA256 digests to the math profile while preserving the recorded functions and metadata (`reference/governance/math_profile/2025-10-08/math_profile_manifest.json`). 
   - Verified both files by exercising `load_numeric_policy`, `load_math_profile_manifest`, and `build_numeric_policy_attestation`, which now complete without raising.
   
* 6:09am:
   - Introduced hurdle_simulation.priors.yaml as the versioned seed for synthetic training priors, capturing RNG, hurdle, NB-mean, and dispersion offsets (`config/models/hurdle/hurdle_simulation.priors.yaml`).
   - Built a typed loader for that file so downstream code can reason about priors without hand-parsing YAML.
   - Added a reusable universe loader that reopens the merchant ingress parquet, joins GDP/bucket metadata, converts channels to CP/CNP, and (optionally) drops rows without macro coverage to keep simulations stable.
   - Wired everything under a new `engine.training.hurdle` namespace for clean imports.
   - Exercised the new pieces with targeted tests to catch schema regressions and confirm the enriched universe carries the expected log-GDP signal.

* 6:12am:
   - Introduced `engine.training.hurdle.simulator` with `simulate_hurdle_corpus`, which:
      - Seeds a NumPy RNG from the governed priors, deterministically builds synthetic brand IDs, and aggregates channel evidence.
      - Computes hurdle logits (base + MCC/channel/bucket offsets + noise) and samples `is_multi`.
      - Generates zero-truncated negative-binomial outlet counts with priors over mean and dispersion (including GDP slope), yielding the NB training table for multi-site brands only.
      - Returns a `SimulatedHurdleCorpus` dataclass bundling logistic rows, NB rows, brand aliases, channel roster, plus a convenience summary.
   - Updated the package namespace so everything is importable via `engine.training.hurdle`.
   - Added reproducibility/structure tests in `tests/engine/training/test_hurdle_simulation_phase2.py`. These assert deterministic outputs, channel vocabulary, multi counts ≥ 2, and sensible summary metrics.
