   - Updated the governance artefacts so S0’s loaders now accept them. Added the mandatory numeric-policy switches (`binary_format`, `rounding_mode`, `fma_allowed`, etc.) and kept the existing merchant/GDP/channel thresholds (`reference/governance/numeric_policy/2025-10-07/numeric_policy.json`). 
   - Added a proper artifacts array with SHA256 digests to the math profile while preserving the recorded functions and metadata (`reference/governance/math_profile/2025-10-08/math_profile_manifest.json`). 
   - Verified both files by exercising `load_numeric_policy`, `load_math_profile_manifest`, and `build_numeric_policy_attestation`, which now complete without raising.
