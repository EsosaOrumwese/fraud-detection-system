* 8:58am:
   - Created the S4 package skeleton under packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/ with config/error stubs, L0–L3 namespace placeholders, and a placeholder runner that surfaces S4_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
   - Exported the new scaffolding via packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/__init__.py.
   - Added a smoke test ensuring the config normalises inputs and the runner raises the expected placeholder error
