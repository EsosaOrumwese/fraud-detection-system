* 8:58am:
   - Created the S4 package skeleton under packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/ with config/error stubs, L0–L3 namespace placeholders, and a placeholder runner that surfaces S4_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
   - Exported the new scaffolding via packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/__init__.py.
   - Added a smoke test ensuring the config normalises inputs and the runner raises the expected placeholder error \n* 1:42am:\n   - Completed S4 phases 2-4: added dataset loaders, deterministic allocation kernel with residue-based tie-breaks, and materialisation pipeline producing run reports + determinism receipts (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s4_alloc_plan/{l0,l1,l2}).
   - Implemented S4 validator/observability stack with recomputation checks and determinism enforcement; exposed scaffolding via segment namespace and new failure taxonomy (E401-E411).
   - Delivered regression coverage spanning allocation math, runner materialisation, and validator error paths (	ests/engine/l1/seg_1B/test_s4_alloc_plan_scaffolding.py); refreshed the S4 runbook with execution/validation instructions (docs/runbooks/s4_alloc_plan.md).
