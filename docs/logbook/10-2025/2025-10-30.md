* 9:59am:
   - Segment 1A now stages Segment 1B’s governed reference surfaces automatically; use --no-stage-seg1b-refs only if you explicitly want to skip it (packages/engine/src/engine/cli/segment1a.py (lines 273-283)). No more manual copy/paste into <run>/reference/**.
   - Added a repository Makefile that wraps the full workflow. make segment1a (or make all) runs 1A with the canonical parameters, writes $(RUN_ROOT)/segment1a_result.json, and stages references; make segment1b reads the hashes directly from that JSON and launches 1B. Set RUN_ROOT, SEED, LOG, SEG1A_EXTRA, or SEG1B_EXTRA on the command line if you need variants. Profiling hooks (make profile-all, make profile-seg1b) emit profile.segment1a/profile.segment1b via cProfile. See Makefile (lines 1-85) for the concrete command templates.
