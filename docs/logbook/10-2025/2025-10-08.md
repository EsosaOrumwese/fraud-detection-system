* 5:45am
	* Curated the `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` reference dataset (868 merchants across 249 ISO-2 markets, 565 MCCs) from the open MCC/ISO artefacts with deterministic RNG seeding and channel heuristics.
	* Emitted CSV+Parquet artefacts, SHA256 sums, and a manifest anchored to git commit `b16d88a7`, capturing artefact digests for reproducibility.
	* Registered the dataset in the 1A dictionary so S0 ingestion can resolve the canonical merchant universe via `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml#/merchant_ids`.

* 6:10pm
	* Baseline sanity: current `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` holds 868 merchants (2–5 per ISO) and `world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-04-15` covers 17 ISO rows — will expand in upcoming phases.

* 7:00pm
	* Built full `world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-10-07` reference (205 ISO-2 rows) with raw World Bank artefacts staged under `artefacts/economic/...` and manifest digests for reproducibility.
	* Derived `gdp_bucket_map/2025-10-07` using Jenks K=5 breaks; recorded breakpoints and input hash for S0 governance.
      * Finished a deterministic World Bank GDP builder that stages raw API payloads, filters to true ISO‑2 codes, and emits versioned CSV/Parquet with manifest + digests for 205 countries.
      * Added policy scaffolds for channel mix and merchant allocation to drive later phases.
      * Created a Jenks K=5 bucket-map generator wired to the new GDP table, capturing breakpoints and input hashes.
