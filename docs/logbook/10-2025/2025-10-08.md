* 5:45am
	* Curated the `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` reference dataset (868 merchants across 249 ISO-2 markets, 565 MCCs) from the open MCC/ISO artefacts with deterministic RNG seeding and channel heuristics.
	* Emitted CSV+Parquet artefacts, SHA256 sums, and a manifest anchored to git commit `b16d88a7`, capturing artefact digests for reproducibility.
	* Registered the dataset in the 1A dictionary so S0 ingestion can resolve the canonical merchant universe via `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml#/merchant_ids`.

* 6:10pm
	* Baseline sanity: current `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` holds 868 merchants (2-5 per ISO) and `world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-04-15` covers 17 ISO rows - will expand in upcoming phases.

* 7:00pm
	* Built full `world_bank_gdp_per_capita/2025-10-07` reference (205 ISO-2 rows) with raw World Bank artefacts staged under `artefacts/economic/...` and manifest digests for reproducibility.
	* Derived `gdp_bucket_map/2025-10-07` using Jenks K=5 breaks; recorded breakpoints and input hash for S0 governance.

* 7:30pm
	* Pinned channel and merchant allocation policies (`config/policy/channel_policy.1A.yaml`, `config/policy/merchant_allocation.1A.yaml`) with schema validations to ensure bands and parameters align.
	* Published numeric governance policy `reference/governance/numeric_policy/2025-10-07` capturing merchant, GDP, and channel gates for upcoming S0 runs.
	* Rebuilt `build_transaction_schema_merchant_ids.py` to consume GDP/bucket references and policy surfaces, scaling to 20k merchants with deterministic IDs, MCC assignment, and channel balancing.
	* Generated `v2025-10-08` dataset (205 ISO coverage, CNP mix 25.3%) with manifest/SHA digests referencing policies and governance artefacts.
