* 5:45am
	* Curated the `transaction_schema_merchant_ids` reference dataset (868 merchants across 249 ISO-2 markets, 565 MCCs) from the open MCC/ISO artefacts with deterministic RNG seeding and channel heuristics.
	* Emitted CSV+Parquet artefacts, SHA256 sums, and a manifest anchored to git commit `b16d88a7`, capturing artefact digests for reproducibility.
	* Registered the dataset in the 1A dictionary so S0 ingestion can resolve the canonical merchant universe via `schemas.ingress.layer1.yaml#/merchant_ids`.
