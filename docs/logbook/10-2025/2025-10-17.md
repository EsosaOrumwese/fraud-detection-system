* 3:53am:
   - Added an s8_outlet_catalogue package skeleton with constants, context/data models, kernel/persist/validation stubs, and a runner scaffold so future S8 work has well-defined entry points.
   - Verified the S8 spec and existing contract entries so the scaffold aligns with the mandated datasets, event families, and validation artefacts—no contract edits were required.

* 4:05am:
   - Implemented the S8 deterministic loader so it now assembles sequencing inputs from the merchant universe, hurdle outcomes, NB finals, and S7 allocation results. It raises precise errors when upstream artefacts are missing or inconsistent, and emits MerchantSequencingInput objects with validated per-country counts
   - Added loader unit tests covering both the happy path and a missing-S7 scenario, ensuring singles and multis are handled correctly
