* 3:53am:
   - Added an s8_outlet_catalogue package skeleton with constants, context/data models, kernel/persist/validation stubs, and a runner scaffold so future S8 work has well-defined entry points.
   - Verified the S8 spec and existing contract entries so the scaffold aligns with the mandated datasets, event families, and validation artefacts—no contract edits were required.
