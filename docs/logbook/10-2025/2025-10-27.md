* 1:19am:
   - packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s1_tile_index/l2/runner.py now logs every expensive step: when ISO/polygon/raster artefacts load (with sizes), when tile enumeration starts/finishes, periodic progress every 25 countries, and when each parquet partition is written. These messages surface right in the Segment 1B CLI stdout thanks to the earlier logging.basicConfig change.
   - packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s2_tile_weights/l2/runner.py emits INFO logs for ISO/tile-index loads, mass computation, quantisation, and final partition writes, so you can watch S2 chew through the large frames instead of wondering if it hung.
