* 2:55am:
   - Done with fleshing out and reviewing until green state-5 to state-9 docs. That is the state files for 1A is now complete. Time for implementation.

* 3:44am:
   - Created config/allocation/ccy_smoothing_params.yaml with the spec-compliant structure (semver, version, dp, defaults, per-currency overrides, ISO overrides). Values are conservative placeholders so the pipeline can move forward; any change will flip parameter_hash per spec.
   - Opened docs/engineering-decisions/state5_ccy_smoothing_params.md to capture the rationale, assumptions, and TODOs for this configuration so future calibrations are easy to track.
