* 2:55am:
   - Done with fleshing out and reviewing until green state-5 to state-9 docs. That is the state files for 1A is now complete. Time for implementation.

* 3:44am:
   - Created config/allocation/ccy_smoothing_params.yaml with the spec-compliant structure (semver, version, dp, defaults, per-currency overrides, ISO overrides). Values are conservative placeholders so the pipeline can move forward; any change will flip parameter_hash per spec.
   - Opened docs/engineering-decisions/state5_ccy_smoothing_params.md to capture the rationale, assumptions, and TODOs for this configuration so future calibrations are easy to track.

* 4:20am:
   - Added the missing iso_legal_tender_2024 artefact end‑to‑end: created its directory under reference/iso/iso_legal_tender/2024/, derived a deterministic ISO→currency mapping (max-share fallback from ccy_country_shares) into iso_legal_tender.parquet, and dropped lightweight manifest/qa companions for quick QA checks. Coverage currently matches the currencies present in the smoothing shares; I noted that limitation in docs/engineering-decisions/state5_iso_legal_tender.md so we can expand it when richer data arrives.
   - Wired the dataset into our contracts: new schema anchor contracts/schemas/l1/seg_1A/iso_legal_tender.schema.json, contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml now lists the dataset (and states includes S5), and the public artefact registry doc records the reference entry.
   - Captured the ingestion decision in docs/engineering-decisions/state5_iso_legal_tender.md so the provenance of the mapping and its assumptions remain easy to find.
   - contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml:5 now includes state S5 and lists ccy_country_weights_cache, merchant_currency, sparse_flag, the governed ccy_smoothing_params policy, and the new iso_legal_tender_2024 reference dataset.
   - contracts/schemas/l1/seg_1A/iso_legal_tender.schema.json provides the schema anchor for the legal-tender map.
   - docs/model_spec/data-engine/specs/contracts/1A/artefact_registry_1A.yaml:373 gained a iso_legal_tender_2024 registry entry.
   - docs/engineering-decisions/state5_iso_legal_tender.md records how the dataset was derived.
   - Built reference/iso/iso_legal_tender/2024/ with iso_legal_tender.parquet plus manifest/QA metadata for deterministic ingestion.
