* 12:04am:
   - S2 spec + contract review complete; key takeaways captured (multi merchants only, NB2 links, RNG labels gamma_component, poisson_component, nb_final, validation/error codes like ERR_S2_ENTRY_NOT_MULTI, ERR_S2_NUMERIC_INVALID).
   - The dataset dictionary now advertises the S2 streams. In contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml I added s2 to the states list and registered rng_event_gamma_component, rng_event_poisson_component, and rng_event_nb_final, each with the correct schema refs, partitions, and gating (gated_by: rng_event_hurdle_bernoulli). Layer schemas already covered these streams, so no changes were needed there.

* 12:15am:
   - Added compute_nb_links and compute_links_from_design in packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l1/links.py. They reuse the S0 design vectors and governed beta_mu/beta_phi bundles to produce deterministic NB2 parameters (eta_mu, eta_phi, mu, phi) with the same Neumaier/binary64 policy as S0/S1, and raise ERR_S2_NUMERIC_INVALID if the results are non-finite or non-positive.
   - Exported the helpers via packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/__init__.py so orchestrators can import them.
   - Added regression coverage (tests/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/test_s2_nb_links.py) that checks the dot products, exponentiation, dictionary alignment, and shape-mismatch failure case.
   - Updated the dataset dictionary header (contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1A/layer1.1A.yaml:1) to flag that the file now covers S2 as well.

* 4:43am:
   - Implemented the deterministic S2 context builder so only hurdle-approved merchants enter the NB stage and their links are computed with the governed coefficients (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l2/deterministic.py`).
   - Added Philox substream helpers plus an event writer that stamps gamma/poisson component envelopes and the non-consuming nb_final log with trace accumulation (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l1/rng.py`, `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l2/output.py`).
   - Built the NB sampler runner that loops attempts, enforces rejection counting, emits all three event streams, and returns the accepted outlet counts for later states (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l2/runner.py`).

* 4:59am:
   - Segment1A orchestration now flows through S2: we capture the NB deterministic inputs, execute the sampler, and expose downstream contexts alongside the existing hurdle data (`packages/engine/src/engine/scenario_runner/l1_seg_1A.py`).
   - Added the replay validator that regenerates gamma/poisson draws, checks envelopes, and cross-verifies nb_final against optional runner output `(packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l3/validator.py`).
   - Tightened the S2 surface: exports now include the deterministic builder/runner, the CLI gained a dedicated entry point, and RNG logs land under the expected partitions (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/__init__.py`, `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l2/runner.py`, `packages/engine/src/engine/cli/s2_nb_outlets.py`, `packages/engine/src/engine/cli/__init__.py`).
   - Added focused tests that exercise the runner+validator happy path and detect tampered logs (`tests/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/test_s2_nb_validator.py`).
   - Hooked the Segment1A orchestrator up to S2: after S1 it now builds the deterministic NB context, runs the sampler, validates it, and exposes an S2StateContext alongside the existing hurdle context (packages/engine/src/engine/scenario_runner/l1_seg_1A.py).
   - Added a dedicated CLI entry point (engine.cli.s2_nb_outlets) that loads sealed artefacts, regenerates hurdle decisions, runs S2, emits result metadata, and optionally validates the logs (packages/engine/src/engine/cli/s2_nb_outlets.py, packages/engine/src/engine/cli/__init__.py).
   - Delivered a deterministic S2 validator that replays gamma/poisson draws and checks nb_final invariants, plus new unit tests for links, validator, and the CLI happy-path (packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l3/validator.py; tests under tests/engine/...).

* 5:15am:
   - Wired the Segment1A orchestrator to call S2 and capture NB counts alongside the hurdle context, exposing `S2StateContext` for downstream states (`packages/engine/src/engine/scenario_runner/l1_seg_1A.py`).
   - Added an S2 CLI (`packages/engine/src/engine/cli/s2_nb_outlets.py`) that consumes sealed artefacts, runs the NB sampler, writes result metadata, and optionally validates emitted RNG logs.
   - Implemented the S2 RNG validator replaying gamma/poisson draws and added CLI/integration coverage (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s2_nb_outlets/l3/validator.py`, `tests/engine/cli/test_s2_nb_cli.py`, `tests/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/test_s2_nb_validator.py`).

* 5:31am:
   - Unified S0/S1/S2 progress logging conventions ("Sx: … (elapsed, delta)") so operators see consistent timing envelopes across the pipeline.
   - Extended the S2 validator to emit corridor metrics (rho_reject, p99, CUSUM) while replaying RNG events; metrics bubble up through Segment1A orchestration and the new CLI.
   - Added a `segment1a` CLI that drives S0→S2 end-to-end via `Segment1AOrchestrator`, emits run summaries/metrics, and reuses the state validators.
