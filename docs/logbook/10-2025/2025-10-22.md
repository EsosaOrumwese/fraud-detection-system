* 5:53pm:
   - Added the 1B gate orchestration (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/s0_gate/l2/runner.py` plus its L0/L1 helpers) to load index.json, recompute the ASCII-lex SHA256, enforce _passed.flag, validate reference surfaces, check outlet catalogue lineage with Polars, and publish an idempotent `s0_gate_receipt_1B`.
   - Recorded the contract surface for 1B (`contracts/dataset_dictionary/l1/seg_1B/layer1.1B.yaml`, `contracts/schemas/layer1/schemas.1B.yaml`) so dictionary resolution and schema validation mirror the spec.
   - Introduced Segment 1B shared utilities (`packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1B/shared/dictionary.py`, `.../shared/schema.py`) and the failure taxonomy (`.../s0_gate/exceptions.py`) to keep error codes and refs consistent with the design.
   - Exercised the gate behaviour with focused pytest coverage (`tests/engine/l1/seg_1B/test_s0_gate.py`), covering success, hash mismatches, idempotent reruns, and immutable-rewrite protection.
