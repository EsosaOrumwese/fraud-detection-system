* 2:05am:
   - Expanded `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s4_ztp_target/README.md#L1` to capture the preparation outcomes: inputs/gates the runner must assemble, governed artefacts that influence `parameter_hash`, the failure vocabulary we’ll map onto `S0Error`, and the resume/trace invariants for the forthcoming writers.
   - The README now documents the current code surface (contexts only) so later layers can land against a shared contract without re-scraping the expanded spec.
   - Added frozen label/stream literals so later layers share one source of truth.
   - Implemented `ZTPEventWriter` with consuming/non-consuming guards, partitioned JSONL output, and cumulative trace updates after every event.
   - Exposed the new primitives through the L0 package init for easy import downstream.
   - Documented the preparation baseline and inputs/failures/resume expectations in the S4 module README.
