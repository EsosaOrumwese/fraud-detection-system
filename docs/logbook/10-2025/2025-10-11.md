### Reference commits: Check commits on this date (if any)

* 2:05am:
   - Expanded `packages/engine/src/engine/layers/l1/seg_1A/s4_ztp_target/README.md#L1` to capture the preparation outcomes: inputs/gates the runner must assemble, governed artefacts that influence `parameter_hash`, the failure vocabulary we’ll map onto `S0Error`, and the resume/trace invariants for the forthcoming writers.
   - The README now documents the current code surface (contexts only) so later layers can land against a shared contract without re-scraping the expanded spec.
   - Added frozen label/stream literals so later layers share one source of truth.
   - Implemented `ZTPEventWriter` with consuming/non-consuming guards, partitioned JSONL output, and cumulative trace updates after every event.
   - Exposed the new primitives through the L0 package init for easy import downstream.
   - Documented the preparation baseline and inputs/failures/resume expectations in the S4 module README.

* 2:19am:
   - Added deterministic constants and the ZTPEventWriter so L0 now owns envelope stamping and trace updates.
   - Implemented L1 kernels: lambda/regime computation, Philox substream derivation, and the attempt loop that logs attempts, rejections, finals, and exhaustion markers.
   - Introduced S4ZTPTargetRunner to drive merchants end-to-end and emit outcomes plus path references, and seeded validator expectations for downstream L3 work.
   - Extended the failure taxonomy to cover new S4 error codes and refreshed the package README to describe the new layers.
