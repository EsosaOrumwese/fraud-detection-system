## Cluster 7 — Data Engine realism governance + remediation waves

### What Cluster 7 is claiming (plain English)

You didn’t accept “synthetic data” as vibes. You measured realism, diagnosed root causes, designed remediation waves with gates, and you’re executing it with freeze/non-regression discipline.

To certify it, I need **one segment** (1A is perfect) from **baseline report → remediation plan → executed remediation → new certification outcome**.

### Cluster 7 — Verification Questions (Round 1)

1. What is your realism grading model (what “B/B+” means, and what gates are hard vs soft)?
2. Choose one segment you’ve actually remediated (1A):

   * baseline failure signature (top 3 issues)
   * chosen fixes
   * what you froze to prevent regression
3. What metrics did you use (and why those metrics matter)?
4. What was the hardest tradeoff (realism vs compute, realism vs stability, realism vs determinism)?
5. What was the post-remediation outcome (grade + remaining gaps + your plan)?
6. Give one “causal proof” example: how you knew *this fix* moved *that metric* (not noise).
7. For an unimplemented segment (e.g., 6B): what is Wave-0 blocker and why must it precede everything else?
