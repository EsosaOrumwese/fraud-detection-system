EXPERIENCE LAKE ENTRY — CLUSTER 08
Title: Managed-substrate migration program (dev_min) — guardrails, authority stack, packaging immutability, IaC discipline, secrets least-privilege, and fail-closed IAM materialization incident
As-of: 2026-02-14
Status: IN-PROGRESS overall (M0–M3 DONE; M4 active with incident closure proven). Semantics preserved from local_parity baseline; substrate/runtime promotion underway with evidence bundles.

1) Header Block — Identity + Claim
1.1 One-sentence truth claim (defensible, not a vibe)
I am executing a governed migration (“dev_min Spine Green v0”) that preserves the exact local_parity spine semantics (P0–P11 + P12 teardown) while swapping substrate and runtime to managed services under strict cost/security constraints; the program is evidence-first (phase closeout packages), drift-resistant (authority stack + stop/log/repin), and fail-closed on missing identity/secret/runtime contracts—demonstrated by a real M4.C IAM materialization failure that blocked progression until Terraform role surfaces were materialized and revalidated PASS.

1.2 Scope (what this entry covers)
IN-SCOPE:
- dev_min objective and semantic invariants (preserve baseline scope + phase meaning + run identity + ingress truth + append-only evidence)
- Non-negotiable guardrails (budget posture, demo→destroy, no NAT, no always-on LB dependency, no laptop runtime compute)
- Authority stack for migration (what wins when docs conflict)
- M0–M3 DONE posture (governance lock → packaging immutability → substrate readiness → run pinning)
- Packaging posture (single-image + entrypoint matrix + provenance binding)
- IaC posture (Terraform desired state + scripts for verification/evidence; teardown proof)
- Secrets/bootstrap posture (SSM handles, anti-leak, least privilege verified by IAM simulation)
- One real migration incident (M4.C IAM role materialization failure) with fail→fix→pass evidence

OUT-OF-SCOPE:
- Full production environment (this is dev_min proof rung; demo→destroy)
- Learning/Registry plane closure (out-of-scope for Spine Green v0 baseline)
- Business/model objectives beyond “spine runs correctly under managed constraints”

1.3 One-line migration goal (interview-safe)
dev_min Spine Green v0 = run the same proven local_parity spine lifecycle (P0..P11 + P12 teardown) on managed substrate and managed compute with zero semantic drift; change wiring/substrate, not platform laws.

1.4 Core invariants preserved from local_parity (non-negotiable)
- same baseline scope contract (Control+Ingress, RTDL, Case+Labels, Run/Operate+Obs/Gov; learning out-of-scope)
- same phase-machine meaning (no shortcut skips)
- same run identity discipline (platform_run_id + scenario_run_id anchored)
- same ingress truth laws (fail-closed, idempotency, dedupe, payload-hash anomalies, receipt truth)
- same append-only evidence posture (no in-place mutation shortcuts)
- same explicit degrade posture (no silent guessing)
- same replay basis and closure rigor (no unresolved ambiguity at green close; single-writer governance closeout)

2) Context — Why this mattered
2.1 The “cloud theatre” trap
A lot of migrations are “we ran it once in the cloud.” That proves almost nothing.
This migration is structured as:
- a credibility rung under constraints (cost, identity, secrets, runtime boundaries)
- a proof that the platform semantics survive real infra boundaries
- a program where teardown and cost control are first-class (not afterthoughts)

2.2 Why dev_min exists
- to prove promotion from local parity to managed substrate without losing meaning
- to create credible, repeatable “demo-grade” runs with durable evidence
- to avoid paying for always-on infra while still validating managed constraints

3) Guardrails — Non-negotiable operational laws
These are hard laws; if violated, migration is invalid:

3.1 Budget posture (low-cost envelope)
- target: ~£30/month
- escalation thresholds pinned (example ladder: £10 / £20 / £28)
- fail condition: cannot show controlled budget posture → phase cannot close green

3.2 Demo→destroy default posture
- expensive runtime resources are ephemeral (demo window only)
- persistence reserved for evidence/core control surfaces
- teardown is part of lifecycle closure (P12)
- fail condition: demo resources remain → operationally non-compliant

3.3 No NAT Gateway
- prohibited as a cost footgun
- fail condition: NAT presence blocks phase closure until removed

3.4 No always-on LB dependency
- dev_min must not require permanent ALB/NLB baseline
- bounded, justified use only
- fail condition: always-on LB dependency required for “runnable” claim → posture drift

3.5 No laptop runtime compute
- laptop orchestrates and inspects only
- runtime compute must execute on managed ephemeral infra (ECS tasks/services)
- fail condition: any required lane depends on laptop execution → migration closure blocked

4) Authority Stack — What wins when docs conflict (pinned filenames)
When conflict exists: higher authority wins; if unresolved, STOP/log/repin.

Definition: DONE = DoD closed, blockers empty, evidence artifacts published, next-phase handoff explicit.

5.1 M0 — Mobilization + Authority Lock (DONE; doc-first)
- governance model: single status owner, phase transition law, evidence templates, anti-drift stop protocol

  - checks.iam_simulation.execution_role_allowed_count = 0 (implicitDeny)

5.4 M3 — Run Pinning (DONE)

Pinned run artifacts:
- pinned run: platform_20260213T214223Z
- m3_f_verdict_snapshot.json (ADVANCE_TO_M4)
- m4_runtime_scope_bundle.json
- m3_run_pinning_snapshot.json
- m4_handoff_pack.json

6) Packaging posture — Why it is credible (not “docker build succeeded”)
6.1 Single-image strategy (deliberate)
- reduces drift across many lanes
- simplifies provenance verification (one immutable identity per posture)
- keeps focus on substrate/runtime correctness over multi-image complexity
- safety controls: explicit include/exclude contract; no ambiguous COPY . .

6.2 Entrypoint matrix (fully pinned)
The single image is safe only because entrypoints are explicit and validated:
- Oracle jobs (seed/pack, stream-sort, checker)
- Control/Ingress (SR, WSP, IG)
- RTDL core (ArchiveWriter, IEG, OFP, CSFB)
- Decision lane (DL, DF, AL, DLA, CaseTrigger)
- Case/Label (CM, LS)
- Closure lane (reporter)

Missing/unresolved entrypoints are blockers (fail closed).

6.3 Provenance binding (immutable chain)
- commit SHA → git-<sha> tag
- tag → OCI digest
- CI metadata → packaging evidence artifacts
- packaging evidence must agree with run.json/run anchors (fail closed on mismatch)

7) IaC posture — Terraform vs scripts, drift prevention, teardown proof
7.1 Ownership split
- Terraform owns desired infra state
- scripts own verification + orchestration glue + evidence publication
(No “scripts replace Terraform” anti-pattern.)

Repo roots:
- infra/terraform/dev_min/core
- infra/terraform/dev_min/confluent
- infra/terraform/dev_min/demo
- tools/dev_substrate (evidence scripts / orchestration)

7.2 Drift prevention
- no manual console drift accepted
- state partitioning (core/confluent/demo) with locking discipline
- handle registry is executable contract (unknown/missing handles fail closed)
- phase blockers explicit; unresolved blockers block progression
- evidence-backed closure only; one plan owns status transitions

7.3 Teardown proof (not optional cleanup)
- pre-destroy viability checks recorded
- destroy surfaces pinned and scoped to demo resources
- post-destroy checks confirm no cost-bearing demo resources remain
- teardown evidence is part of lifecycle closure (P12)

8) Secrets/bootstrap posture — least privilege by design and proof
8.1 Canonical SSM handle model (examples)
- SSM_CONFLUENT_BOOTSTRAP_PATH
- SSM_CONFLUENT_API_KEY_PATH / SSM_CONFLUENT_API_SECRET_PATH
- SSM_IG_API_KEY_PATH
- SSM_DB_USER_PATH / SSM_DB_PASSWORD_PATH (optional SSM_DB_DSN_PATH)

8.2 Forbidden surfaces (hard fail)
- secrets in Docker build ARG/ENV
- copying env files into image
- printing decrypted secrets in logs/artifacts
- execution role as secret superuser
- publishing decrypted values in evidence/logbooks

8.3 Role boundary model + verification
- ROLE_ECS_TASK_EXECUTION: pull/log only, no secret-read
- app/runtime roles: path-scoped ssm:GetParameter only for required pinned paths
- provisioning roles: materialize/update paths; not runtime principals
Verification proof:
- IAM simulation snapshot: app role allowed 6/6; execution role allowed 0/6

9) Real migration incident — M4.C IAM role materialization fail-closed
9.1 Incident summary
At M4.C, runtime readiness failed closed because service→role handles were pinned in design but not materialized as real IAM roles in substrate yet.

9.2 Failure context
- working run: m4_20260214T121004Z
- lane: M4.C (IAM binding validation)
- failure evidence:
  - runs/dev_substrate/m4/20260214T121004Z/m4_c_iam_binding_snapshot.json
  - overall_pass=false
  - blockers included:
    - M4C-B4 (unmaterialized ROLE_* handles)
    - M4C-B1 (invalid/unresolved app-role bindings)
    - M4C-B2 (dependency access posture unverifiable while roles missing)

9.3 Fix (layer-correct)
A) Terraform demo-stack expansion
- created lane-role resources for all required handles
- added lane-scoped secret-read policies (path-scoped)
- exposed concrete role outputs for validation

B) Registry/handles closure
- pinned concrete lane role values into migration authority handles
- explicitly included ROLE_ENV_CONFORMANCE for SVC_ENV_CONFORMANCE to close ambiguity gap

C) Gate discipline preserved
- did not bypass M4.C
- reran validation against live Terraform outputs + IAM state

11) Guardrails / Non-regression Controls
11.1 “Change substrate, not semantics” enforcement
- local_parity phase meaning wins; dev_min cannot shortcut
- handles registry is the wiring authority; drift fails closed
- stop/log/repin protocol enforced on conflicts

11.2 Cost/security/risk controls are part of acceptance, not ops hygiene
- budget posture required
- demo→destroy required
- no NAT / no always-on LB required
- no laptop compute required
- secrets least-privilege verified with evidence

12) Residual risks + Next actions
12.1 What remains open
- M4 daemon bring-up and subsequent phase closures (P2..P11) on dev_min under ECS runtime.
- Maintain evidence parity and teardown closure (P12) under demo posture.

12.2 Next actions
- proceed from M4.C PASS into daemon bring-up with REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID injection
- re-run Spine Green v0 acceptance sequence under dev_min using the same closure bundle logic
- continue to mirror evidence bundles to dev_min evidence bucket for auditability

13) Extraction notes (for later mining)
13.1 30-second version (recruiter)
“I’m migrating a multi-service fraud platform from local parity to a managed dev_min rung under strict cost/security laws. I locked semantics, built an evidence-first phase program, and caught a real IAM materialization failure in M4 that blocked progression until roles and policies were actually created—proven with fail/pass snapshots.”

13.2 2-minute version (hiring manager)
“I treat migration as semantic preservation under constraints, not rewriting. I pinned an authority stack, built a single-image entrypoint matrix with immutable provenance, used Terraform as desired-state truth with scripts for verifiable evidence, enforced least-privilege secrets via IAM simulation, and fail-closed an M4 IAM binding gate when required roles weren’t materialized. I only advanced after Terraform materialized roles and a rerun snapshot showed overall_pass=true and blockers empty, with durable evidence mirrored to S3.”
