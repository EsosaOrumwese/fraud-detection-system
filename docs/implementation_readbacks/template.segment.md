# Execution Walkthrough - <Layer> <Segment> (Template)

## Purpose
Implementer-authored operational narrative derived from binding specs and
contracts. This is a review gate, not a new requirement source.

## Status
Status: Draft

## Scope
- Segment:
- States covered:
- In scope:
- Out of scope:

## Execution spine (ordered steps only)
1. <step>
2. <step>
3. <step>

## Step expansions (run order)
Expand each step into a detailed, numbered procedure. Include loops, joins,
lookups, writes, gating, scaling, and determinism/RNG rules directly in the
procedure steps. Do not invent missing behavior. There is no length limit; aim
for full operational clarity.

### Step 1 - <Name>
1. <action>
2. <action>
3. <action>

### Step 2 - <Name>
1. <action>
2. <action>
3. <action>

## Gaps and assumptions
List anything not specified by binding docs.
- UNSPECIFIED: <gap that must be resolved>
- ASSUMPTION (needs approval): <assumption being proposed>

## Traceability (lightweight)
- [SPEC] <path>
- [CONTRACT] <path>
- [POLICY] <path>

## Spec deviations (must be logged before implementation)
- <deviation and rationale>
