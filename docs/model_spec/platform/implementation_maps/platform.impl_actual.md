## Entry: 2026-01-24 22:43:13 — Platform v0 build-plan construction (initial)

### Problem / goal
User requested a platform-wide build plan (v0) that sets expectations for v0/v1/vX and guides component sequencing without locking us into full-detail steps upfront. The plan must be progressive-elaboration: phases only at first, with each phase broken into sections + DoD only when that phase begins. It must align to the platform blueprint, deployment-unit map, environment ladder, and truth-ownership doctrine.

### Authorities / inputs (binding)
- Root `AGENTS.md` (progressive elaboration rule, no half-baked phases, rails + truth ownership, logging discipline).
- `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/platform_blueprint_notes_v0.md` (graph, pins, truth ownership, rails).
- `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/deployment_tooling_notes_v0.md` (environment ladder, deployment units, substrate map, config policy posture, reference stack).
- Data Engine interface pack (boundary contract; no engine internals).
- Platform narratives (control+ingress; decision loop; label/case; learning/evolution; observability/governance).
- Existing SR build plan + impl_actual to avoid drift in SR scope.

### Decision trail / reasoning (live notes)
- The platform plan must be *plane-based* (Control+Ingress, Decision Loop, Label/Case, Learning/Registry, Obs/Gov) rather than just component-by-component, because the blueprint organizes truth ownership and join semantics by plane. This makes dependencies explicit and reduces drift.
- The plan should still name the major components to make scope measurable, but their sequencing should follow the plane order: SR+IG first (world readiness + admission), EB wiring next, then hot-path state/projection (IEG/OFP/DL/DF/AL/DLA), then Label/Case, then Learning/Registry, then Observability/Governance hardening.
- v0 should be production-shaped but minimal: single-region, single-tenant, local/dev parity, strict rails. v1 should cover scale/HA/multi-tenant, backfill/archive and stronger governance automation. vX should capture forward-looking capabilities (advanced multi-world orchestration, policy automation, richer model lifecycle, etc.).
- DoD needs to be concrete but not over-specified at the plan stage. Each phase DoD should be expressed as hard outcomes (interfaces present, invariants enforced, tests proving readiness). Detailed step lists should be deferred until entering that phase, per AGENTS.

### Alternatives considered (and why rejected)
- **Component-by-component plan only**: rejected because it hides cross-plane invariants and makes it easy to violate truth ownership boundaries.
- **Over-detailed step list from day one**: rejected because it conflicts with the progressive-elaboration rule and tends to become stale or misleading.
- **V0 only with no v1/vX**: rejected because user explicitly asked for expectation-setting beyond v0.

### Decisions to lock for this plan
- Use a *plane-first phase order* aligned to blueprint and narratives.
- Include explicit v0 scope boundary and v1/vX expectation ladder.
- Define phase DoD in terms of enforceable rails (pins, gates, idempotency, append-only, by-ref) + integration tests.
- Keep platform stack vendor-neutral but assume the reference local stack (Kafka-compatible EB + S3-compatible object store + Postgres + OTel stack) as the operational model, without hard-coding credentials.

### Immediate next actions
- Create `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/platform.build_plan.md` with v0 phases + DoD, and a v1/vX expectations section.
- Add a logbook entry with timestamp noting this planning step.
