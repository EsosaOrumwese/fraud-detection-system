# Dev Full Track Maps
_As of 2026-02-22_

This folder is reserved for `dev_full` planning and implementation notes.

## Intended contents
- `platform.build_plan.md` (dev_full master phase plan and status owner)
- `platform.impl_actual.md` (dev_full implementation decision trail)
- `platform.M*.build_plan.md` (deep plans per active phase)
- `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-full_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md` (dev_full migration authority)
- `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_platform_green_v0_run_process_flow.md` (dev_full phase/gate authority)
- `docs/model_spec/platform/migration_to_dev/dev_full_handles.registry.v0.md` (dev_full handle authority)

## Current posture
- Initialization complete:
  - `platform.impl_actual.md` created.
  - dev_full migration authority created and section pins closed.
  - dev_full run-process authority created.
  - dev_full handles registry drafted.
  - `platform.build_plan.md` created with `M0` active.
  - `platform.M0.build_plan.md` created for deep M0 planning.
- `dev_min` remains closed and isolated under `../dev_min/`.
