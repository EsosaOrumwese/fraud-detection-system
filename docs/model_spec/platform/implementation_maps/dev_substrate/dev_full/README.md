# Dev Full Track Maps
_As of 2026-02-22_

This folder is reserved for `dev_full` planning and implementation notes.

## Intended contents
- `platform.build_plan.md` (dev_full phase plan)
- `platform.impl_actual.md` (dev_full implementation decision trail)
- `platform.M*.build_plan.md` (deep plans per active phase)
- `docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-full_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md` (dev_full migration authority)

## Current posture
- Initialization complete:
  - `platform.impl_actual.md` created.
  - dev_full migration authority document created in pre-design decisions.
- `dev_min` remains closed and isolated under `../dev_min/`.
