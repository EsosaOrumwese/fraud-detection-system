# Platform Stress-Test Implementation Map (dev_full)
_As of 2026-03-03_

## Entry: 2026-03-03 05:37 +00:00 - Program pivot decision

### Trigger
1. User directed a pivot from throughput-plan framing to stress-testing-first framing.
2. User required realistic production standards and adaptive bottleneck-first decisioning.

### Decision
1. Adopt a dedicated stress-test authority path under `dev_full/stress_test/`.
2. Preserve phase alignment with build ladder (`M0..M15`).
3. Enforce progressive elaboration: create only program-level stress authority now, phase files later.

### Result
1. `platform.stress_test.md` created as active program authority.

## Entry: 2026-03-03 05:42 +00:00 - Folder architecture decision (`build/` + `stress_test/`)

### Alternatives considered
1. Immediate relocation of all existing build docs into `build/`.
2. Safe routing first, then phased migration.

### Evaluation
1. Alternative 1 rejected:
   - high path-drift risk against existing status-owner references.
2. Alternative 2 selected:
   - satisfies requested folder architecture,
   - avoids immediate breakage in existing dev_full document routing.

### Result
1. Added `build/README.md` with migration-safe policy.
2. Added `stress_test/README.md` and program control file.

## Entry: 2026-03-03 05:49 +00:00 - Local development clarification captured as binding rule

### Decision
1. Explicitly pin in stress authority:
   - local engineering work is normal and required,
   - no-local-compute restriction applies to runtime/cert posture, not design and coding activity.

### Result
1. Prevents repeated process confusion and workflow over-reliance for early debugging.

## Entry: 2026-03-03 05:54 +00:00 - Throughput draft retirement

### Trigger
1. User requested ditching throughput-hardening framing.

### Decision
1. Remove throughput draft docs from active workspace.
2. Keep stress-test authority as single active hardening direction.

### Result
1. Throughput draft files removed.
2. `dev_full/README.md` updated to reflect retirement and stress-test authority activation.
