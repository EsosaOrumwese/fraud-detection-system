# Platform Build Plan (dev_substrate)
_As of 2026-02-10_

## Purpose
Track phased execution for the `local_parity -> dev` substrate promotion while preserving platform semantic rails.

## Phase frame
- Phase 1: substrate contract lock + environment/profile mapping
- Phase 2: control & ingress substrate cutover in dev
- Phase 3: RTDL substrate cutover in dev
- Phase 4: case/labels and learning/registry substrate cutover in dev
- Phase 5: observability/governance + reconciliation closure in dev

## Notes
- Detailed sections/DoD must be progressively elaborated as each phase begins.
- Legacy baseline plans remain in `../local_parity/`.
