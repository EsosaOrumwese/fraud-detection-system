# Dev-min Evidence Contracts (v0)
_As of 2026-02-10_

This folder pins the run-evidence summary schemas referenced by:
`docs/model_spec/platform/pre-design_decisions/dev-min_managed-substrate_migration.design-authority.v0.md`.

Scope:
- run summary header,
- ingress receipt summary,
- audit summary,
- replay-anchor summary,
- metrics/anomaly/reconciliation snapshot.

These are run-bundle summary contracts for the `dev_min` migration rung. They do not replace component-native event contracts.
