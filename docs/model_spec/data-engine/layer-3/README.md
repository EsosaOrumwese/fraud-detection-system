# Layer-2 Data Engine Specs

Layer-2 introduces Segments **5A** and **5B**. This folder mirrors the Layer-1 layout so state-flow and contract specs stay isolated per layer.

- `specs/state-flow/5A/` and `specs/state-flow/5B/` — state-expanded docs for the new segments.
- `specs/contracts/5A/` and `specs/contracts/5B/` — dictionaries, schema addenda, catalog artefacts.
- `narrative/` — design briefs, conceptual narratives specific to Layer-2.
- `deprecated__assumptions/` — any retired hypotheses captured during planning.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the run-order and authority surface expectations.
