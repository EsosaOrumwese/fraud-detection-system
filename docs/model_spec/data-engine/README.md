# Data Engine Model Specs

This directory now routes specs by **Layer**. Each layer keeps its own AGENTS, narratives, contracts, and state-flow specs so we can freeze Layer-1 while Layer-2 evolves.

- [Layer 1 — Layer-1 S0–S5, 1A–3B docs](layer-1/README.md) (see also `layer-1/specs/AGENTS.md`).
- [Layer 2 — Upcoming Segment 5A/5B planning area](layer-2/README.md) (router: `layer-2/AGENTS.md`).

Add future layers (e.g., `layer-3/`) beside these folders and link them here the same way.
