# Data Engine Specs Router

Use this file to orient across layers:

| Layer | Scope | Router |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Layer 1 | Layer-1 / Segments 1A-3B (specs sealed) | [layer-1/specs/AGENTS.md](layer-1/specs/AGENTS.md) |
| Layer 2 | Layer-2 / Segments 5A & 5B (specs sealed; implementation next) | [layer-2/AGENTS.md](layer-2/AGENTS.md) |
| Layer 3 | Layer-3 / Segments 6A & 6B (specs sealed; implementation next) | [layer-3/AGENTS.md](layer-3/AGENTS.md) |

When a new layer spins up, add its directory beside `layer-1`/`layer-2`/`layer-3` and register it here.
