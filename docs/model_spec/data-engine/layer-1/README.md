# Layer-1 Data Engine Specs

This folder contains the existing Layer-1 documentation (Segments 1A–3B) exactly as it lived before the re-org. Key entry points:

- `specs/AGENTS.md` — router for all Layer-1 states.
- `specs/state-flow/` — per-segment expanded specs.
- `specs/contracts/` — schema packs, dictionaries, artefact registries.
- `narrative/` / `deprecated__assumptions/` — conceptual notes retained for history.

All references that previously pointed at `docs/model_spec/data-engine/...` should now point at this `layer-1/` subtree.
