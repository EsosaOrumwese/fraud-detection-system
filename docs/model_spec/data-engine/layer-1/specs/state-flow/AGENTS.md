# AGENTS.md — State-Flow Specs Router

- Scope: 1A/1B state specs only. Use these docs to understand behavioural contracts; do not edit `src/` code unless the USER explicitly opens implementation work.
- Specs are minimal by design: state overview + binding headers + TODO markers. Implementation guidance belongs to the engine packages.
- When expanding a state doc, focus on: purpose/scope, inputs/outputs, invariants, evidence surfaces (run reports, receipts). Leave algorithm detail to implementation stages.
- Follow the USER's instruction before modifying any state spec; no drive-by edits. If work is not approved, treat the folder as read-only.
- Cross-reference contracts under `../contracts/` and README directions in `docs/model_spec/data-engine/specs/AGENTS.md` for global rules.
