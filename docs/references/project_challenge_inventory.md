    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_baseline_gap_ledger.md:78`

41. Root-cause tracing was performed for every `Critical/High` gap with confidence and falsification checks, creating an explicit diagnosis layer rather than ad-hoc fixes.
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step2_root_cause_trace.md:1`
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step2_root_cause_trace.md:50`
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step2_root_cause_trace.md:158`

42. A one-to-one hypothesis and acceptance plan exists for all identified gaps (`1.1..2.21`), with fail-closed statistical gating requirements.
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step3_hypothesis_acceptance_plan.md:21`
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step3_hypothesis_acceptance_plan.md:260`

43. Remediation scope was operationalized into a 26-work-package backlog split into three dependency-locked waves.
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step4_execution_backlog.md:11`
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step4_execution_backlog.md:35`
    - Evidence: `docs/reports/eda/engine_realism_step4_execution_backlog.md:39`

44. Wave-0 is explicitly platform-blocking and must clear critical 6B truth/bank/timeline gates before any Wave-1 work is allowed.

### H) Post-2026-02-11 remediation execution and certification challenges

46-AA. P1 initially used the wrong authority surface for single-site realism (reading global single-site share from `outlet_catalogue` while S3/S8 remained multi-site scoped), creating false failure interpretation until metrics were remapped to S1/S2 surfaces.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3639`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3645`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3650`

46-AB. S2 Poisson PTRS path emitted statistically impossible extreme counts (`lambda~11` but `k=12808`), contaminating concentration metrics and blocking trustworthy calibration.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3868`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3874`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:3882`

46-AC. P2 `rho` closure was blocked by S3/S5 domain intersection emptiness (`ZERO_WEIGHT_DOMAIN` dominance), proving S6 tuning alone could not close realization-ratio gates.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4358`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4365`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4426`

46-AD. Remaining `rho` blocker was structural S5 support sparsity (many foreign-impossible merchants), forcing scope extension to S5 support broadening rather than further S3/S4/S6-only tuning.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4493`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4498`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4516`

46-AE. Global `median(rho_m)` stayed blocked by denominator definition (`C=0` structural mass), creating a governance-level decision boundary between cohort-meaningful scoring and upstream population-scope reopen.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4610`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4612`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4617`

46-AF. P3.1 was blocked by S7 dirichlet diagnostic emission (`E_DIRICHLET_NONPOS`), and the first alpha-floor hotfix introduced pathological gamma runtime stalls; a second corrective strategy was required (skip dirichlet payload when share<=0 while preserving deterministic integerisation).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4796`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4839`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4846`

46-AG. S7 home-bias rollout surfaced floating-point residual edge failures (`residual_out_of_range`) that required quantization hardening without loosening real out-of-domain failure checks.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4940`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4961`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:4964`

46-AH. Same-seed replay drift persisted after P4 because RNG master material was tied to `manifest_fingerprint` (commit-sensitive) rather than `parameter_hash`, violating expected reproducibility law.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5269`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5273`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5280`

46-AI. P5 certification tooling had authority-mapping and schema-path drift risks (P3 authority run binding and identity-semantics key-path variants), which could have produced false certification verdicts.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5413`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5417`

46-AJ. B+ recovery in 1A proved locally infeasible in the tested coefficient neighborhood (top10 vs gini trade-off wall), forcing explicit rollback and acceptance of certified B to prevent wider-regression risk.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5498`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5512`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5516`

46-AK. 1B path-1 upstream reopen introduced a hard governance tension: improve 1B while guaranteeing 1A frozen grade cannot be spoiled, requiring executable freeze-veto guard contracts.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5522`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5527`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1A.impl_actual.md:5533`

46-AL. In 1B P1 execution, S2 `blend_v2.population` caused full-raster sampling timeouts, making end-to-end tuning loops operationally non-viable until staged influence reduction was applied.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3511`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3514`

46-AM. Reusing run IDs for retry cycles collided with immutable partition rules in S5, forcing strict fresh-run bootstrapping discipline for each integrated retry.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3528`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3531`

46-AN. P2 anti-collapse tuning appeared no-op because the observed allocation was already at a theoretical floor; acceptance logic had to be reworked to feasibility-aware floor-hold semantics instead of naive strict-improvement rules.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3682`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3690`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3694`

46-AO. P3 geometry closure under frozen P1/P2 support hit a feasibility ceiling; out-of-pixel displacement experiments then failed fail-closed at S7 contract checks (`E707_POINT_OUTSIDE_PIXEL`).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3821`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3832`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:3885`

46-AP. 1B integrated closure remained RED even after improvements, with concentration/coverage hard gates and collapse sentinels still failing, requiring guarded upstream reopen path instead of bounded local retune.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:4130`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:4152`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:4243`

46-AQ. S4 became a dominant runtime bottleneck during path-1 cycles (high cache miss/eviction churn), requiring performance-only cache rails and bounded sweeps before further recovery loops.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:4274`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/data-engine/implementation_maps/segment_1B.impl_actual.md:4335`

## Phase 3 - Local Parity Platform Challenges

### A) Control and Ingress foundation challenges (SR/WSP/IG/EB/Oracle)

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/event_bus.impl_actual.md:54`

### D) Learning lane and archive challenges (OFS/MF/Archive)

85. OFS started with high drift risk because implementation sequencing lacked explicit component build-plan authority.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:670`

88. OFS exposed a governance bypass risk where protected-ref enforcement could be weakened by config and required unconditional fail-closed hardening.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:927`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:940`

89. OFS Phase-8 test fixtures uncovered admission and retry-surface mismatches (`LABEL_TYPE_SCOPE_UNRESOLVED`, `RUN_NOT_FOUND` vs expected `RETRY_NOT_PENDING`) that required corrective setup.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:799`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:801`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:241`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:259`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:261`

91. MF had to prevent unresolved refs/run-scope/schema incompatibility from leaking into train/eval, with immutable resolved-plan enforcement.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:340`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:354`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/model_factory.impl_actual.md:361`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10524`

95. Segment-level remediation specs exist across engine segments with exact code/policy deltas, hard gates, and grade-lift targets, but they are framed as planning/execution packages for subsequent remediation waves.

## Phase 3 (Deep Pass) - Platform-Level Operational Blockers From Implementation Notes

97. Full dev-completion runs could not finish on local hardware (2-hour uncapped attempt), forcing an environment-ladder reality where local remained smoke-only.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:527`

98. Parity smoke failed because IG service resolved to stale installed code instead of repo source, exposing Python path drift as an operational risk.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:733`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:739`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:756`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:763`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1058`

101. WSP READY checkpointing also failed at runtime when checkpoint DSN propagation was missing (`CHECKPOINT_DSN_MISSING`).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1077`

102. Parity runs hit stream-view identity mismatch (`STREAM_VIEW_ID_MISMATCH`) between local and MinIO-S3 rooted views.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1199`

103. Run identity semantics required explicit correction so WSP envelopes carry SR `scenario_run_id` while preserving engine provenance pins.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1890`

104. RTDL live runtime surfaced dual caveats that required explicit root-cause pinning: missing source `schema_version` and publish-time `QUARANTINE` outcomes.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3279`

106. OFP exhibited a 194/200 processing gap under live parity due startup-position race and required replay reconciliation hardening.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3399`

107. Orchestrated launch encountered runtime ownership conflict from stale manual process occupancy on ingress port, requiring explicit hygiene decisions.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3847`

108. Orchestrated packs initially used system Python and failed immediately with missing runtime deps (`ModuleNotFoundError: psycopg`), requiring interpreter pinning.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3885`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3888`

109. Run-scope precedence in orchestration had to be hardened so stale env vars cannot override active-run truth (`ACTIVE_RUN_ID`) and mis-scope evidence.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3936`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3943`

110. Drift sentinel detected a material meta-layer mismatch before requested full-platform run: orchestration coverage was incomplete for newly required planes.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8441`

113. WSP control-bus consumption had starvation semantics: repeated TRIM_HORIZON head-page reads prevented progress to fresh READY records.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8465`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8478`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8512`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8517`

115. CaseMgmt/LabelStore parity alignment exposed shared Postgres SQL-rendering contract drift, causing runtime failures in the Case/Label plane.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8628`

116. Make targets had evidence-scoping drift where stale shell `PLATFORM_RUN_ID` overrode active run selection and wrote outputs into wrong run scope.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8711`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8717`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8728`

117. Shared Kinesis consumer resilience hardening became necessary to survive stale-sequence and transient reader faults without worker collapse.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:8934`

118. A platform-wide P0 incident was recorded where frequent Postgres reconnect patterns collapsed daemon packs (`OperationalError` address-in-use).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9006`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9015`

119. First connector hardening pass introduced transaction-lifecycle side effects (`idle in transaction`/lock waits), requiring psycopg context parity fixes.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9179`

120. Only after Postgres lifecycle hardening did strict 20->200 full-stream parity validation stabilize, proving infrastructure-lifecycle correctness was a gating challenge.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9207`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9250`

## Phase 3 (Deep Pass) - Platform Plan-Level Closure Pressure

121. Control & Ingress still carried explicitly open pins that had to be deferred and resolved through RTDL planning/partition alignment, creating cross-phase dependency pressure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:298`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:299`

122. Platform sequencing imposed a hard meta-layer gate: Phase 5 remained blocked until Phase 4.6 (Run/Operate + Obs/Gov) fully passed.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:865`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:867`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:956`

123. Full parity execution introduced explicit remaining-open closure TODOs (`4.6.L`) that had to be worked down before normal progression.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:982`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1011`

124. A dedicated throughput/efficiency gate (`5.10`) was inserted as a blocker so Learning/Registry could not begin until stream hot-path budgets were proven or risk-accepted.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1188`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1216`

125. Learning plane closure was constrained by mandatory meta-layer gates (`6.6/6.7`) even after substantial MF/OFS implementation progress, preventing premature “done” claims.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1531`

126. Phase 6.8 defined a formal plane integration closure gate with explicit block-on-fail posture before Phase 7 progression.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1427`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.build_plan.md:1439`

## Phase 3 (Deep Pass) - Architecture and Sequencing Churn (Platform Notes)

127. Platform authority hierarchy itself needed correction to resolve ambiguity between core platform-wide notes and supplemental guardrail docs.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:536`

128. Runtime boundary doctrine had to be explicitly corrected: Oracle Store is external engine truth, not an internal platform runtime vertex.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:574`

129. Local-vs-dev substrate drift pressure required a dedicated maximum-parity stack migration program (compose/config/profile + infra alignment).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:616`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:637`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:700`

130. Stream-view design went through repeated contract reversals (initial layout, bucket-partition correction, then flat-layout correction), indicating nontrivial semantics hardening.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1129`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1152`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1170`

131. Traffic/context channel policy oscillated across multiple corrections (dual-channel, single-fraud default, context-preloader removal, traffic-only narrowing, then traffic+context restoration).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1586`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1651`

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:1731`

132. Phase status reporting drift had to be corrected when 4.3 was effectively component-complete but still labeled in-progress, forcing explicit reclassification discipline.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2052`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2058`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2070`

133. Phase 4.4 was too placeholder-level to execute safely and required full phased expansion to avoid interpretation drift in DF/DL closure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2079`

134. RTDL integration had explicit unresolved A/B drifts (IG onboarding for DF outputs + missing join-plane placement), requiring additional platform-phase insertion (`4.3.5`) and structural map split.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2329`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2365`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2399`

135. Pre-runtime hardening was required to prevent shared-stream semantic drift (DF families incorrectly mutating OFP/IEG paths) before join-plane runtime work could begin.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2421`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:2458`

136. Meta-layer closure had to be promoted to an explicit blocking phase before Case/Label progression, revealing earlier sequencing under-specification.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3544`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3578`

137. Run/Operate orchestration DoD itself required hardening to enforce plane-agnostic behavior and remove contradictory wording that could cause implementation drift.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3610`

138. Orchestrator rollout exposed non-obvious validation defects (Windows YAML path escaping and probe-port env-token parsing), requiring corrective fixes before closure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:3814`

139. Validation-matrix evidence itself drifted and required corrective updates (`4.6.B` wording stale after new evidence), showing governance bookkeeping as an active challenge.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4398`

140. Evidence corridor validation revealed governance append contention (`S3_APPEND_CONFLICT`) under parallel probes, requiring serialized evidence collection posture.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4556`

141. Phase 4.6 closure matrix initially failed due test-harness dependency drift (`werkzeug.__version__` assumption), not business-logic regressions, demanding compatibility remediation.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4682`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4683`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4691`

142. Decision-lane daemonization exposed a real implementation/runtime gap: DL/DF/AL/DLA remained matrix-only while live packs ran only IEG/OFP/CSFB.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:4894`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5115`

143. Decision-lane onboarding then failed on missing projection DSN contract (`CSFB projection_db_dsn is required`), requiring pack-level correction.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5148`

144. SR live-run execution was blocked by wiring contract fault (`WiringProfile.profile_id` missing), requiring runtime schema correction before parity run continuation.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5222`

145. AL outcome publication lane had a P0 canonical timestamp contract defect (`+00:00` vs `...Z`) causing total ambiguous publish outcomes.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5506`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5508`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5590`

146. DF fail-closed behavior was traced to upstream cohort drift: WSP checkpoints were shared across runs, creating zero overlap between traffic and flow-anchor cohorts until run-scoped checkpoint keys were introduced.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5634`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5644`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5646`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:5728`

147. Learning-plane planning was initially too coarse (single high-level Phase 6 DoD), creating explicit drift risk until split into granular closure gates.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9289`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9290`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9347`

148. Archive dependency was originally implicit in learning flow and had to be elevated into an explicit blocking `6.0` gate to avoid authority/operability ambiguity.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9364`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:9416`

149. Implementation-trail scalability itself became a challenge: map growth and track conflation forced a formal local_parity/dev_substrate split with routing continuity controls.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10618`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10621`

## Phase 3 (Deep Pass) - Component Implementation Notes (local_parity)

150. Scenario Runner ingress initially failed JSON Schema validation because Python-native model dumps (datetimes/nulls) were validated directly against JSON contracts.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/scenario_runner.impl_actual.md:235`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/scenario_runner.impl_actual.md:240`

151. Scenario Runner ledger writes had the same JSON-compatibility defect, so plan/status persistence could fail on datetime/null encoding.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/scenario_runner.impl_actual.md:272`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/scenario_runner.impl_actual.md:278`

152. `RunPlan.plan_hash` computation had a serialization fragility and needed JSON-safe hashing to avoid runtime datetime errors.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/scenario_runner.impl_actual.md:509`

153. SR gate verification drifted from engine law for Segment 6B and had to be realigned to index-driven raw-byte hashing semantics.

226. OFS Phase-3 resolver initially leaked unstable raw I/O failures instead of deterministic fail-closed error taxonomy codes.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:343`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:349`

227. OFS protected-reference enforcement could be weakened by config toggle (`evidence_ref_strict=false`) before unconditional fail-closed hardening.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:927`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/offline_feature_plane.impl_actual.md:931`

228. Archive Writer daemon startup failed in parity Postgres mode due reserved SQL identifier usage in ledger schema.

    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/archive_writer.impl_actual.md:61`

### F) Spine Green v0 post-closure validation and remediation notes

228-AA. First post-closure 200-event Spine Green run surfaced residual platform-wide closure defects (DLA unresolved lineage amber, parity-status learning-plane strictness, and IG unauthorized health-path error semantics).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10674`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10689`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10691`

228-AB. `platform-operate-parity-status` was too tightly coupled to Learning-plane env vars for a Spine-only migration baseline, making subset-scope validation fail when Learning was intentionally out of scope.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10690`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10695`

228-AC. DLA unresolved lineage amber traced to startup replay-window intake gaps (AL/DLA first-window behavior), requiring startup hardening to prevent missing outcome-link cascades.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10689`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10707`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10715`

228-AD. IG ops-health unauthorized path returned `500` instead of contract-aligned auth semantics, requiring route error-mapping hardening to fail closed with `401`.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10722`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/local_parity/platform.impl_actual.md:10730`

## Phase 4 - Dev Substrate Migration Challenges (local_parity -> dev)

229. The core migration challenge started as a framing trap: building platform semantics and production substrate simultaneously was effectively two jobs.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:79`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:82`

230. A key mental-model shift was required to define what migration actually meant: `local_parity` as correctness harness vs `dev` as managed-substrate proof with unchanged laws.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:90`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:91`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:142`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:144`

231. Migration design had to avoid an overkill stack explosion (`K8s+Flink+Temporal+full MLOps`) that would stall delivery.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:261`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:262`

232. Budget reality became a first-class migration constraint (legacy free-tier posture, no direct credit cushion, strict monthly cap).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:534`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:538`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:541`

233. Kafka substrate choice was nontrivial because MSK cost and VPC-only access introduced operational friction at the dev rung.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:551`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:556`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:596`

234. Networking cost traps (especially NAT) were identified as migration risk factors that could invalidate the dev cost posture.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:604`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:606`

235. The final dev strategy itself was a compromise challenge: Confluent-first daily path plus limited MSK demo runs for portability proof.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:672`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:677`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/platform-wide/dev_substrate_to_production_resource_tooling_notes.md:700`

236. Dev migration authority initially had residual inconsistencies (bad reference paths, open/closed decision mismatch, missing pinned artifacts), weakening implementer certainty.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:93`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:99`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:101`

237. Migration execution lacked a usable roadmap until the coarse 5-line plan was rewritten into phased wave gates with explicit DoD and drift checks.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:173`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:184`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:188`

238. Track split introduced a documentation-routing hazard where active decisions were accidentally written to a legacy map path, creating dual-authority drift risk.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:122`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:126`

239. Early migration planning became too heavyweight; user rejected auxiliary Phase 0 artifacts, forcing a simplification back to authority-first sources.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:299`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:303`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:312`

240. A separate contract-surface churn occurred when `dev_min` auxiliary schemas were introduced, then removed and repinned to existing contract families to reduce migration friction.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:358`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:361`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:383`

241. Phase 1 was materially blocked by secret-materialization gaps: required Kafka credentials were absent from the active shell/env surfaces.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:540`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:546`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:550`

242. Env-surface ambiguity between local/parity and dev migration contexts required dedicated `.env.dev_min` conventions to stop accidental cross-surface coupling.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:570`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:574`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:582`

243. Phase 3.B infrastructure readiness initially failed due wrong Kafka readiness interface assumptions (`:443` REST path) and missing settlement-mapped env bindings.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1321`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1322`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1327`

244. Even after endpoint-mode correction, the Kafka corridor remained fail-closed on SASL authentication, correctly preventing false progression while other surfaces were green.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1353`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1359`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1361`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1374`

245. A concrete operator-config drift was diagnosed in bootstrap porting (`:443` vs required broker `:9092`), requiring target hardening so CLI overrides beat stale env files.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1401`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1403`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1407`

246. Oracle migration carried high interpretation risk until managed-only, non-local gate language was enforced to prevent local-parity semantics leaking into `dev_min`.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1522`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1525`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1538`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1543`

247. Oracle ownership and sequencing doctrine had to be explicitly corrected: engine produces Oracle artifacts; platform consumes/syncs; integrated acceptance is blocked until Oracle gate is fully green.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1603`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1614`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1618`

248. "Nothing stays local" had to be formally repinned into SR migration gates (managed-only acceptance, strict ladders, re-emit governance, fail-closed Oracle pin mismatch).
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1837`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1843`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1846`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1851`

### Addendum: Post-2026-02-11 migration execution challenges

248-AA. Migration planning had to be reframed from abstract intent into an explicit local-to-managed compute playbook with full local process decomposition, otherwise "proceed" decisions lacked executable closure criteria.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:1971`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:2019`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:2156`

248-AB. Build-go packaging lane initially failed on cloud identity and registry permissions (GitHub OIDC + ECR auth), exposing that migration execution depended on control-plane trust wiring, not just application code.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6219`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6223`

248-AC. M1 build-go surfaced a decision-completeness gap (`IMAGE_DOCKERFILE_PATH` missing), blocking packaging execution despite prior planning closure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5605`

248-AD. Core Terraform apply readiness was blocked by state reality mismatch (empty backend state with already-existing resources), forcing controlled import/migration instead of unsafe first apply.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6519`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6524`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6553`

248-AE. During M2.C pass, accidental shell expansion removed canonical core stack files, creating an operational fragility incident that required controlled restoration and revalidation.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6536`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6542`

248-AF. Demo apply readiness exposed capability-gap blockers and required explicit capability expansion before fail-closed closure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6631`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6694`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6728`

248-AG. Secret-materialization and access checks failed initially (`M2.E` blockers), proving handle presence alone was insufficient without live substrate materialization.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6788`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6824`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6839`

248-AH. Cost accrual risk became a practical migration blocker, requiring explicit monitoring and dashboard instrumentation to avoid silent spend drift during iterative bring-up.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6886`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6912`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6951`

248-AI. Kafka readiness closure repeatedly failed on auth and secret-lane mismatch across local and CI execution, forcing first-class Confluent IaC provisioning, CI secret-name mapping hardening, and import-adoption corrections before green closure.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7006`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7043`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7257`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7306`

248-AJ. M3 execution was blocked by unresolved scenario-equivalence inputs, requiring explicit pinning and rerun before progression.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7939`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:7983`

248-AK. Even after M3.C closure, scenario identity remained provisional because Oracle-required output placeholders were still unresolved, creating controlled partiality that had to be explicitly pinned.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8158`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8177`

248-AL. Sequential M3 D->G closure exposed control-plane blocker classes (false-positive immutable run publication conflict, env-map completeness predicate mismatch) that had to be corrected mid-lane to preserve fail-closed progression.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8282`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8288`

248-AM. M4 execution readiness itself became a planning challenge: phase needed lane-complete A->J deep planning before safe runtime start to avoid repeating under-specified execution drift.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8342`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8375`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:8409`

248-AN. Packaging execution governance was initially ambiguous because `github_actions` and `local_cli` were both treated as build lanes without pinned authority hierarchy, creating false-closure risk until authoritative driver semantics and pre-build-go CI gates were explicitly locked.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5808`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5814`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5821`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5828`

248-AO. Build-go sequencing initially lacked explicit exit/handoff ordering after CI realization/gate validation, causing progression-logic ambiguity until handoff was pinned as a post-gate closure requirement.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5821`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5822`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:5828`

248-AP. Migration setup posture began with an implicit UI/manual-first assumption that threatened repeatability, teardown discipline, and drift control; this had to be corrected to IaC-first execution with non-IaC gaps treated as explicit blockers.
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6672`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6678`
    - Evidence: `docs/model_spec/platform/implementation_maps/dev_substrate/platform.impl_actual.md:6687`
