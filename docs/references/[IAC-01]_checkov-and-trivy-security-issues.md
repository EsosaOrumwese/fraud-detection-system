# Solution to Errors
Below is the **triage I’d do as a real-world reviewer** and the **Terraform or suppress-rule changes** I’d make.
Everything is mapped to the scanner IDs you pasted so you can check they really disappear when you re-run *tfsec / Trivy / Checkov*.

---

## 1 Public-IP subnet (CKV\_AWS\_130 / AVD-AWS-0164)

### Why keep it **as-is**

* This is the *sandbox* VPC and you explicitly need an Internet-facing subnet for Fargate/Lambda demos.
* A private-subnet + NAT Gateway would cost \~£25 / month (NAT hourly + data).
* You’ll still apply **least-privilege security groups** around workloads later, so the risk is controlled.

### Action

**Suppress**, don’t “fix”.

```
resource "aws_subnet" "public_a" {
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_130 public subnet is intentional in sandbox
  # tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  ...
}
```

---

## 2 VPC Flow Logs (CKV2\_AWS\_11 / AVD-AWS-0178)

### Why **enable**

Tiny cost (CloudWatch ingestion <£1/month) but invaluable if you ever debug a security incident.

### Code — add this block to **`main.tf`** just below the VPC:

```hcl
resource "aws_flow_log" "vpc" {
  vpc_id          = aws_vpc.main.id
  traffic_type    = "ALL"
  log_destination = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.vpc_fl.arn
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "vpc_fl" {
  name              = "/aws/vpc/${aws_vpc.main.id}"
  retention_in_days = 7         # keep only a week ⇒ cost stays pennies
}
```

---

## 3 S3 bucket encryption (CKV\_AWS\_145 / AVD-AWS-0132)

### Why **upgrade to AWS-KMS**

High severity and zero extra cost if you use *AWS-managed* KMS keys (`aws:kms`).
Customer-managed CMKs cost \$1/month each—fine even in sandbox.

### Code — change the server-side encryption blocks:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "raw" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.raw.id
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      kms_master_key_id = "alias/aws/s3"   # AWS-managed default key
    }
  }
}
```

(do the same for `artifacts` bucket).

---

## 4 Bucket access logging (CKV\_AWS\_18 / AVD-AWS-0089)

### Options

| Option                                 | Cost               | Comment                  |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Enable logging to **the other bucket** | free (same region) | circular dependency risk |
| Create **new logging bucket**          | negligible         | extra resource           |

### Simplest: **suppress** for now (low-risk dev data, tight timeline) and create a backlog ticket to add central logging later.

```
# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18 dev bucket logging deferred to Sprint-03
# tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "raw" { ... }
```

---

## 5 Event notifications (CKV2\_AWS\_62) & Lifecycle rules (CKV2\_AWS\_61)

These are *“nice to have”* housekeeping controls:

* **Notifications** — you’ll add when you wire an S3 → Lambda ingest later.
* **Lifecycle** — you’ll add Glacier/expire rules once you know data retention.

### Action

Suppress with TODO tags:

```hcl
# checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_62 no notifications until ingest pipeline exists
# checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_61 lifecycle rules planned Sprint-04
```

---

## 6 Cross-region replication (CKV\_AWS\_144)

Replication doubles storage cost; not justified for non-PII sandbox.

```hcl
# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_144 replication unnecessary for dev sandbox
```

---

## 7 Default VPC security group (CKV2\_AWS\_12)

Terraform doesn’t touch the default SG; the scanner flags because it *could* allow all.
You can delete/lock the default SG, but that breaks some AWS console wizards.
**Suppress** and rely on explicit SGs for every workload.

```hcl
# checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_12 default SG not used by any module
```

---

## 8 Update your **`.checkov.yaml`** (optional central suppression)

Instead of sprinkling many `checkov:skip` lines you can group the low-risk skips once:

```yaml
skip_checks:
  - CKV_AWS_144   # S3 cross-region replication
  - CKV_AWS_18    # S3 access logging
  - CKV2_AWS_61   # S3 lifecycle
  - CKV2_AWS_62   # S3 notifications
  - CKV2_AWS_12   # default SG restrictive
  - CKV_AWS_130   # public subnet (intentional)
```

Place this file in `infra/terraform/`.

---

## 9 Re-test

```bash
pre-commit run tfsec --all-files
pre-commit run checkov --all-files
```

You should now see **0 HIGH findings**. Medium/Low are acceptable per your CI gating.

---

### Summary of changes

| Scanner finding          | Decision | Terraform change                   |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Public subnet IP         | Accept   | `checkov:skip`, `tfsec:ignore`     |
| Flow logs                | Fix      | `aws_flow_log` + CW log group      |
| S3 SSE-KMS               | Fix      | switch `sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"` |
| Bucket logging           | Defer    | skip with TODO comment             |
| Event notifications      | Defer    | skip                               |
| Lifecycle policy         | Defer    | skip                               |
| Cross-region replication | Defer    | skip                               |
| Default SG open          | Skip     | skip                               |

Commit the fixes + suppressions, push, and your security gates will pass while keeping the sandbox cheap and within sprint scope.
