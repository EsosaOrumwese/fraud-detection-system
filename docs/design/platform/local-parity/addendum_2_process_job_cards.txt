[JOBCARD] Run/Operate Orchestrator (packs)
  Plane: Run/Operate
  Type: OPERATOR + DAEMON SUPERVISOR
  Entry point(s):
    - make platform-operate-control-ingress-up
    - make platform-operate-rtdl-core-up
    - make platform-operate-rtdl-decision-up
    - make platform-operate-case-labels-up
    - make platform-operate-obs-gov-up
    - (shorthand) make platform-operate-parity-up
  Run pins carried: platform_run_id (enforced via *_REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID)
  Inputs:
    - pack YAMLs under config/platform/run_operate/packs/local_parity_*.v0.yaml
    - ACTIVE_RUN_ID file
  Outputs:
    - runs/fraud-platform/operate/<pack_id>/state.json
    - runs/fraud-platform/operate/<pack_id>/status/last_status.json
    - runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/operate/<pack_id>/events.jsonl
    - runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/operate/<pack_id>/logs/<process>.log
  Commit evidence: last_status.json shows RUNNING for all expected processes
  Idempotency: “start if not running” semantics; pack restart is the clean reset
  Checkpoint/state: orchestrator state.json + per-process internal stores
  Required config/env:
    - .env.platform.local loaded by Make
    - ACTIVE_RUN_ID present
  Resource envelope: low (supervision + spawn)
  Fail-closed: pack treats missing env/DSNs as start failure; does not “half-run”
  Reset/retry: use platform-operate-*-restart (avoid ad-hoc duplicate consumers)

[JOBCARD] New platform run id (“active run pin”)
  Plane: Run/Operate
  Type: OPERATOR
  Entry point(s): make platform-run-new
  Run pins carried: platform_run_id (authoritative for run-scoped paths)
  Inputs: local workspace (runs/fraud-platform)
  Outputs:
    - runs/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID
    - runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/... (run root)
  Commit evidence: ACTIVE_RUN_ID exists + run root created
  Idempotency: NOT idempotent (creates new run); re-run -> new run_id
  Reset/retry: prefer new run_id rather than “cleaning” a dirty run scope

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# ORACLE STORE (THE HEAVY BATCH PLANE)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

[JOBCARD] Oracle sync (engine outputs -> MinIO)
  Plane: Oracle Store
  Type: BATCH JOB
  Entry point(s): make platform-oracle-sync
  Run pins carried: none (oracle pack is scenario-scoped; platform_run_id is downstream)
  Inputs:
    - ORACLE_SYNC_SOURCE (local filesystem engine run path)
  Outputs:
    - ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT (s3://oracle-store/... in MinIO) populated with datasets
  Commit evidence: objects exist under ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT (non-empty)
  Idempotency: copy-style; safe to re-run if source/target unchanged
  Required config/env (minimum):
    - ORACLE_SYNC_SOURCE
    - ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT
    - MinIO endpoint/creds via .env.platform.local
  Resource envelope: disk + IO heavy (copies into MinIO volume)
  Fail-closed: missing creds/endpoint => fails; do not proceed to pack/sort
  Reset/retry: re-run sync; if wrong root, wipe the wrong prefix and resync

[JOBCARD] Oracle pack + seal (manifest + _SEALED.json)
  Plane: Oracle Store
  Type: BATCH JOB
  Entry point(s):
    - make platform-oracle-pack ORACLE_PROFILE=... ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT=... ORACLE_SCENARIO_ID=... ORACLE_ENGINE_RELEASE=...
    - (optional) make platform-oracle-check-strict ORACLE_PROFILE=... ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT=...
  Run pins carried: scenario_run_id is derived downstream; pack is oracle truth boundary
  Inputs:
    - engine datasets in ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT
    - ORACLE_PACK_ROOT (s3://oracle-store/.../pack_current)
  Outputs:
    - oracle manifest files under ORACLE_PACK_ROOT
    - _SEALED.json under ORACLE_PACK_ROOT (write-once boundary)
  Commit evidence: _SEALED.json exists (+ strict check OK)
  Idempotency:
    - pack is idempotent only if inputs identical
    - MANIFEST_MISMATCH => must use fresh pack root and re-pack
  Required config/env:
    - ORACLE_PROFILE=config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml
    - ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT, ORACLE_PACK_ROOT, ORACLE_SCENARIO_ID, ORACLE_ENGINE_RELEASE
  Resource envelope: moderate
  Fail-closed:
    - MANIFEST_MISMATCH is a hard stop (forces new pack root)
  Reset/retry:
    - set a fresh ORACLE_PACK_ROOT (e.g., pack_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ) then rerun

[JOBCARD] Oracle stream view sort (ts_utc strict ordering)  **MIGRATION-CRITICAL**
  Plane: Oracle Store
  Type: BATCH JOB (CPU+RAM+DISK heavy)
  Entry point(s):
    - make platform-oracle-stream-sort ORACLE_PROFILE=... ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT=... ORACLE_SCENARIO_ID=...
    - per-output: add ORACLE_STREAM_OUTPUT_ID=<output_id>
    - convenience targets:
        make platform-oracle-stream-sort-traffic-both ...
        make platform-oracle-stream-sort-context-fraud ...
        make platform-oracle-stream-sort-context-baseline ...
  Run pins carried: scenario scope (stream_view id derived from ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT + ORACLE_SCENARIO_ID + output_id)
  Inputs:
    - raw engine outputs in ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT (MinIO)
    - output_id lists (traffic/context YAML refs) unless overridden
  Outputs:
    - ORACLE_STREAM_VIEW_ROOT/.../output_id=<output_id>/part-*.parquet
    - per output_id:
        _stream_view_manifest.json
        _stream_sort_receipt.json
    - ordering: ts_utc then filename then file_row_number
  Commit evidence (single “done” proof):
    - _stream_sort_receipt.json per output_id
  Idempotency:
    - idempotent per output_id if a VALID receipt exists (skip)
    - receipt conflict => FAIL (no silent overwrite)
  Checkpoint/state: receipt+manifest are the job’s state; no external checkpoint store needed
  Required config/env:
    - ORACLE_STREAM_VIEW_ROOT points to base .../stream_view/ts_utc
    - ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT must be the MinIO s3:// path (not local runs/... path)
  Resource envelope + knobs:
    - STREAM_SORT_THREADS
    - STREAM_SORT_MEMORY_LIMIT
    - STREAM_SORT_MAX_TEMP_SIZE
    - STREAM_SORT_TEMP_DIR
    - STREAM_SORT_CHUNK_DAYS (use 1 to reduce OOM; outputs multiple ordered parts)
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - STREAM_VIEW_PARTIAL_EXISTS => delete that output_id prefix and rerun
    - STREAM_VIEW_ID_MISMATCH => wrong ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT (fix env, rerun)
  Reset/retry:
    - delete ONLY the output_id view prefix when partial/corrupt
    - do NOT delete receipts unless you are intentionally re-materializing the view

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# CONTROL PLANE (READINESS / ACTIVATION)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

[JOBCARD] SR run-reuse (build + publish READY)
  Plane: Control
  Type: ACTIVATION (one-shot)
  Entry point(s):
    - set SR_RUN_EQUIVALENCE_KEY="parity_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ"
    - make platform-sr-run-reuse SR_WIRING=config/platform/sr/wiring_local_kinesis.yaml
  Run pins carried:
    - platform_run_id is pinned from runs/fraud-platform/ACTIVE_RUN_ID for this invocation
    - scenario_run_id is derived via equivalence key registry/lease discipline
  Inputs:
    - Oracle Store (MinIO): reads oracle_engine_run_root (s3://oracle-store/...)
    - SR wiring profile (must point at oracle root)
    - Postgres SR lease store (enforces leader per scenario_run_id)
  Outputs:
    - SR run ledger/artifacts under s3://fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/sr/...
    - READY published to sr-control-bus (LocalStack Kinesis)
  Commit evidence:
    - platform.log contains “SR: READY committed” + “READY published”
  Idempotency / dedupe (current posture):
    - READY can be emitted multiple times; message_id is deterministic (scenario-based)
    - SR uses leases; LEASE_BUSY means “same key already leased”
  Checkpoint/state:
    - SR lease row in Postgres (TTL default 300s)
  Required config/env:
    - ACTIVE_RUN_ID present
    - SR_WIRING sets oracle_engine_run_root to MinIO s3:// path
    - MinIO creds must allow SR writes to fraud-platform bucket
  Resource envelope: moderate
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - 403 => MinIO creds/endpoint wrong (fix before proceeding)
    - LEASE_BUSY => new equivalence key OR wait TTL OR clear lease
  Reset/retry:
    - safest: new SR_RUN_EQUIVALENCE_KEY per attempt
    - clearing lease is a last resort and must be recorded

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# WORLD STREAMING (WSP → IG)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

[JOBCARD] WSP READY consumer “run job” (stream view → IG push)
  Plane: Control+Ingress
  Type: BATCH-ish RUN JOB (bounded), or DAEMON when pack-managed
  Entry point(s):
    - once: make platform-wsp-ready-consumer-once WSP_PROFILE=config/platform/profiles/local_parity.yaml
    - pack-managed: included in control_ingress pack (do not run once in parallel)
  Run pins carried:
    - consumes READY (scenario_run_id basis) and emits envelopes carrying platform_run_id pins
  Inputs:
    - Control bus: sr-control-bus (READY)
    - Object store: ORACLE_STREAM_VIEW_ROOT/output_id=<id>/part-*.parquet
    - Checkpoint store: PARITY_WSP_CHECKPOINT_DSN (exported as WSP_CHECKPOINT_DSN)
    - IG ingest endpoint: IG_INGEST_URL (expects /v1/ingest/push)
  Outputs:
    - HTTP POST to IG (/v1/ingest/push)
    - pack-managed logs under:
        runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/operate/local_parity_control_ingress_v0/logs/wsp_ready_consumer.log
    - once-mode logs under:
        runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/world_streamer_producer/...
  Commit evidence:
    - WSP logs show “stream start” and “stream stop” for the run
  Idempotency / dedupe (current posture):
    - WSP dedupes READY by message_id and skips if prior status == STREAMED
    - restart without checkpoints can replay; IG dedupe absorbs duplicates
  Checkpoint/state (current posture):
    - checkpoint per (pack_key, output_id) in Postgres (WSP_CHECKPOINT_DSN)
  Required config/env:
    - PARITY_CONTROL_BUS_* exported correctly (else CONTROL_BUS_STREAM_MISSING)
    - ORACLE_ENGINE_RUN_ROOT must match the stream view built (else STREAM_VIEW_ID_MISMATCH)
    - IG_INGEST_URL set (else Invalid URL '/v1/ingest/push')
    - IG auth profile exported (api_key mode in local_parity): WSP must send X-IG-Api-Key token expected by IG
    - enforce on every ingest POST; ops-health auth checks do not substitute for ingest auth
  Resource envelope + knobs (behavior-changing):
    - WSP_READY_MAX_EVENTS (per output in concurrent mode)
    - WSP_MAX_EVENTS_PER_OUTPUT (explicit per-output cap)
    - WSP_OUTPUT_CONCURRENCY
    - WSP_READY_MAX_MESSAGES (protect against TRIM_HORIZON replays)
    - WSP_PROGRESS_EVERY / WSP_PROGRESS_SECONDS
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - STREAM_VIEW_MISSING => oracle sort not done
    - TRIM_HORIZON replay => WSP restarts/restreams; fix by limiting READY messages or clearing control bus
    - IG returns 401 UNAUTHORIZED => missing/wrong X-IG-Api-Key header/token in WSP profile/env
  Reset/retry:
    - safest: cap run (20/200) then scale
    - never run duplicate WSP consumers with same checkpoint identity

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# INGESTION GATE (ADMISSION AUTHORITY)
# ------------------------------------------------------------

[JOBCARD] IG HTTP service (admission + receipts + publish)
  Plane: Control+Ingress
  Type: DAEMON SERVICE (must run during WSP streaming)
  Entry point(s):
    - make platform-ig-service-parity
    - health: GET http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/ops/health
      auth contract: unauthenticated -> 401 UNAUTHORIZED; authenticated (X-IG-Api-Key) -> 200 health payload
    - ingest: POST /v1/ingest/push
      auth contract (local_parity api_key mode): missing/invalid X-IG-Api-Key -> 401 UNAUTHORIZED
  Run pins carried:
    - admits events for all runs based on envelope pins (platform_run_id present)
  Inputs:
    - HTTP push envelopes from WSP
    - Schema/policy validation (profile-driven)
    - Admission index store: PARITY_IG_ADMISSION_DSN (Postgres)
    - Event bus publisher (LocalStack Kinesis streams)
    - Object store (MinIO) for receipts/quarantine records
  Outputs:
    - EB publish to one of:
        fp.bus.traffic.{fraud|baseline}.v1
        fp.bus.context.arrival_events.v1
        fp.bus.context.arrival_entities.v1
        fp.bus.context.flow_anchor.{fraud|baseline}.v1
    - IG does NOT publish decision/case/audit lanes; those are downstream component outputs
      (DF/AL -> fp.bus.rtdl.v1, DLA -> fp.bus.audit.v1, CaseTrigger -> fp.bus.case.*)
    - Receipts written for ADMIT / DUPLICATE / QUARANTINE:
        s3://fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/ig/receipts/<receipt_id>.json
    - QUARANTINE also writes quarantine_record (payload removed)
  Commit evidence:
    - receipt exists; for ADMIT it contains eb_ref with offset_kind:kinesis_sequence
    - ADMIT commit claim is valid only when receipt + admission-index eb_ref fields are durable
  Idempotency / dedupe:
    - admissions table PRIMARY KEY: dedupe_key
    - CURRENT local_parity dedupe_key = sha256(event_type + ":" + event_id)
      (known gap: omits platform_run_id; cross-run event_id collisions can mark DUPLICATE)
    - dev_min migration requirement (pinned):
      dedupe identity MUST be exactly (platform_run_id, event_class, event_id) with payload_hash anomaly semantics;
      until remediated, IG cannot claim dev_min green.
  Checkpoint/state:
    - admission index rows persist (no TTL/retention by default)
    - fields include receipt_ref + eb_topic/partition/offset/offset_kind/published_at_utc
  Required config/env:
    - parity event bus endpoint/creds
    - required streams exist (else ResourceNotFoundException => bootstrap)
  Resource envelope: moderate; scales with WSP push rate
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - publish error => quarantines and does NOT record dedupe row
    - missing stream => hard fail until stream created
    - publish timeout/transport ambiguity => treat as PUBLISH_UNKNOWN (no ADMIT success claim until eb_ref commit is proven)
    - PUBLISH_UNKNOWN => no successful ADMIT receipt semantics until reconciliation proves commit
    - canonical runtime materialization for PUBLISH_UNKNOWN:
      admission state=PUBLISH_AMBIGUOUS + quarantine artifact in ig/quarantine/ + quarantine receipt in ig/receipts/ (decision=QUARANTINE, reason_codes includes PUBLISH_AMBIGUOUS)
  Reset/retry:
    - receipts are evidence; do not delete to “fix” logic
    - prefer fresh platform_run_id if admission logic changes materially
    - if PUBLISH_UNKNOWN is suspected, pause run closure and reconcile dedupe row + eb_ref + bus presence before replaying

  Idempotency / dedupe:
    - append-only timeline semantics + consumer replay discipline prevent duplicate timeline corruption
  Checkpoint/state:
    - run-scoped local checkpoint store: runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/case_mgmt/consumer_checkpoints.sqlite
      (local_parity implementation detail only; not portable to managed runtime)
    - durable timeline/state in PARITY_CASE_MGMT_LOCATOR
    - dev_min migration requirement (pinned): use managed runtime checkpoint/state backend; no local filesystem checkpoint dependency.
  Required config/env:
    - PARITY_CASE_MGMT_LOCATOR
    - CASE_MGMT_REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID (pack-enforced run scope)
  Resource envelope: moderate (stateful DB writes; low external IO)
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - run-scope mismatch or invalid case payload => reject/quarantine path; no silent timeline mutation
    - DB connectivity failure => fail processing and preserve replay safety
  Reset/retry:
    - restart case_labels pack (preferred)
    - for destructive scratch resets only, wipe CM tables explicitly and log action

[JOBCARD] Label Store (LS) daemon worker + writer boundary (stateful)
  Plane: Case + Labels
  Type: DAEMON WORKER (local_parity pack-managed)
  Entry point(s): pack-managed (case_labels pack): `fraud_detection.label_store.worker`
  Inputs:
    - label assertions submitted through LS writer boundary (primary local flow: CM -> LS)
    - boundary call shape (local_parity runtime): in-process CM handshake -> `LabelStoreWriterBoundary.write_label_assertion(assertion_payload)`
  Writer boundary protocol (local_parity current posture):
    - request payload basis: canonical LabelAssertion mapping (pins + label_subject_key + evidence_refs + deterministic ids/hashes)
    - writer statuses: ACCEPTED | REJECTED (returned by LS boundary)
    - ACCEPTED semantics are emitted only after durable append commit in PARITY_LABEL_STORE_LOCATOR
    - CM handshake status mapping: EMISSION_ACCEPTED | EMISSION_REJECTED | EMISSION_PENDING
      (PENDING is handshake-level on write exception; not a committed LS acceptance)
    - reason-code families:
      ACCEPTED => ASSERTION_COMMITTED_NEW or ASSERTION_REPLAY_MATCH
      REJECTED => CONTRACT_INVALID / MISSING_EVIDENCE_REFS / DEDUPE_TUPLE_COLLISION / PAYLOAD_HASH_MISMATCH
  Outputs: append-only label assertions in Postgres (PARITY_LABEL_STORE_LOCATOR)
  Commit evidence:
    - runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/label_store/health/last_health.json is GREEN
    - runs/fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/label_store/metrics/last_metrics.json shows accepted > 0
  Idempotency / dedupe:
    - append-only label timeline with deterministic assertion identity
    - dedupe basis includes deterministic `label_assertion_id`
    - canonical tuple exposed by contract: (platform_run_id, event_id, label_type, label_assertion_id)
  Checkpoint/state:
    - durable label timeline + governance markers in PARITY_LABEL_STORE_LOCATOR
  Required config/env:
    - PARITY_LABEL_STORE_LOCATOR
    - LABEL_STORE_REQUIRED_PLATFORM_RUN_ID (pack-enforced run scope)
  Resource envelope: moderate (DB-bound with low bus pressure)
  Fail-closed + common failures:
    - contract_invalid / payload_hash_mismatch / missing_evidence_refs => reject path with no silent accept
    - DB write failure => fail processing and preserve append-only truth posture
    - CM handshake write exception => EMISSION_PENDING; retry lane is bounded by label emission policy (no silent ACCEPTED fallback)
  Reset/retry:
    - restart case_labels pack (preferred)
    - retry pending emissions through CM handshake path (bounded by policy max_retry_attempts)
    - for destructive scratch resets only, wipe LS tables explicitly and log action

[JOBCARD] Platform run reporter + environment conformance
  Plane: Obs/Gov
  Type: DAEMON WORKER (pack-managed) OR BATCH JOB (manual)
  Entry point(s):
    - pack-managed (obs_gov pack)
    - manual: make platform-run-report ; make platform-env-conformance ; make platform-governance-query
  Inputs:
    - run-scoped component metrics/health/reconciliation refs
    - object store governance append log
  Outputs (commit artifacts):
    - runs/.../obs/platform_run_report.json
    - runs/.../obs/environment_conformance.json
    - s3://fraud-platform/<platform_run_id>/obs/governance/events.jsonl (append-only)
  Commit evidence:
    - platform_run_report.json exists AND governance append succeeded
  Idempotency:
    - report generation is idempotent; governance append is NOT if multiple writers run
  Fail-closed:
    - S3_APPEND_CONFLICT indicates concurrent writers (stop one, rerun once)

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# CONSUMER START/CHECKPOINT BASIS (LOCAL_PARITY CURRENT POSTURE)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
- WSP READY consumer:
  - no checkpoint => can replay READY history from control bus; bounded by WSP_READY_MAX_MESSAGES + checkpoint identity + IG dedupe
  - checkpoint identity: (pack_key, output_id) in WSP_CHECKPOINT_DSN
- IEG / OFP / CSFB projectors:
  - profile start_position is latest on empty checkpoint
  - restart resumes from projection/checkpoint stores (component DSNs)
- DF worker:
  - profile start_position is latest on empty checkpoint
  - restart/resume basis: DF_REPLAY_DSN + DF_CHECKPOINT_DSN
- AL / DLA workers:
  - local run invariant: first intake with run-scope lock + no checkpoint may start from trim_horizon, then run-scope gate skips non-target runs
  - restart/resume basis: AL_* ledger/replay/checkpoint stores and DLA index/store contracts
- CaseTrigger worker:
  - profile start_position is latest on empty checkpoint
  - restart/resume basis: CASE_TRIGGER_REPLAY_DSN + CASE_TRIGGER_CHECKPOINT_DSN + publish store
- CM service:
  - profile start_position is latest on empty checkpoint
  - restart/resume basis: local sqlite consumer checkpoint + PARITY_CASE_MGMT_LOCATOR timeline state
- LS worker:
  - consumes writer-boundary submissions (not direct EB lane in local_parity card)
  - restart/resume basis: PARITY_LABEL_STORE_LOCATOR append-only timeline/governance markers

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# SMALL BUT IMPORTANT MIGRATION-CRITICAL ITEMS (must be closed before dev_min green)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
- IG dedupe_key currently omits platform_run_id; this is a local_parity-known gap and MUST be remediated before dev_min promotion.
- IG publish ambiguity must be modeled explicitly for dev_min (no implicit assume-success/assume-failure path).
- CM local sqlite checkpoint path is local_parity-only and MUST be replaced by managed runtime checkpoint/state in dev_min.
- READY message_id derivation is scenario-centric; if replay storms emerge in dev_min, include platform_run_id in READY identity under explicit repin.
- Exact consumer-group / checkpoint-id strings live in pack YAML + component config; preserve them during migration
  (so your “restart-safe” claims stay true on Kafka).
