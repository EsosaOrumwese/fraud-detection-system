# ============================================================
# ONE-PAGE MAP — Phase → Job Type → Packaging Target (dev_min)
# Scope: Spine Green v0 (Learning/Registry out-of-scope)
# Pinned dev_min constraints:
#   - CLI-orchestrated (NO Step Functions in v0)
#   - Default compute stays LOCAL (budget-safe)
#   - Optional AWS compute only as ephemeral ECS tasks/services (demo → destroy)
#   - Kafka = Confluent Cloud (demo stack); Evidence/Oracle = AWS S3 (core)
# ============================================================

| P7    | INGEST_COMMITTED (admission + receipts)  | Daemon (IG)            | IG publishes to Kafka topics + writes receipts/quarantine evidence to S3
|       | (receipts are commit evidence)           |                        | Optional: DynamoDB quarantine index (dev_min recommends)              |

| P12   | TEARDOWN (dev_min)                       | Operator teardown      | terraform destroy demo (Kafka + optional ECS + demo-only resources)
|       | (core persists: evidence/oracle)         | (one-shot)             | Keep core buckets + TF state; evidence remains durable                 |

NOTES (so this table actually prevents the “copy/paste to AWS” trap):
- Anything in P3 is a *packaged batch job* (container + explicit IO + idempotent receipts), not “some code”.
- Anything in P2/P8/P9/P10 is a *service* (consumer groups + checkpoints + restart policy).
- v0 dev_min orchestration is CLI-driven: you trigger jobs/services; no Step Functions.
