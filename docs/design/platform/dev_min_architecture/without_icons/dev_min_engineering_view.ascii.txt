DEV_MIN ENGINEERING VIEW (NO ICONS)

Core Root:
  - S3: object-store, evidence, quarantine, archive, tfstate
  - DynamoDB: control-runs, ig-admission-state, ig-publish-state, tf-lock
  - Budget guardrail

Confluent Root:
  - Confluent environment + Kafka cluster + topics
  - Runtime and topic-manager service accounts + API keys
  - Materializes SSM parameters for bootstrap/api_key/api_secret
  - Writes topic_catalog.json to core evidence bucket

Demo Root:
  - Network: VPC, subnets, routing, SG app/db
  - Compute: ECS cluster with daemon services + one-shot jobs
  - Datastores: RDS PostgreSQL, Kinesis control bus
  - Parameters: SSM kafka/db/ingest credentials
  - Artifacts: manifest + topic catalog to evidence bucket

Cross-stack flows:
  - Demo resolves Confluent outputs via terraform_remote_state (or direct vars)
  - ECS services/jobs consume SSM credentials and write to RDS/S3/DynamoDB
  - Runtime uses Confluent Kafka for stream transport
