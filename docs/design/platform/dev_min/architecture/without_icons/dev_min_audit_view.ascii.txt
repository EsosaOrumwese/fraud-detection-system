DEV_MIN AUDIT/GOVERNANCE VIEW (NO ICONS)

Authority Surfaces:
  Terraform roots -> Terraform state bucket -> Terraform lock table

Runtime Truth Surfaces:
  RDS runtime state
  DynamoDB admission/publish/control state
  S3 evidence/object/quarantine/archive

Transport Surfaces (not source of truth):
  Confluent Kafka topics
  Kinesis control bus
  SSM runtime credentials

Fail-closed gates:
  Readiness Gate (managed data-plane viability)
      +
  Closure Integrity Gate (evidence coherence + refs complete)
      ->
  Certification Matrix Gate (semantic, incident, scale, recovery, reproducibility)
      ->
  Outcome: advance only when blockers are empty
