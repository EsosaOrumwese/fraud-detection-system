# ADR-0004 · Sandbox Cost Guard-Rail

*Status — Accepted  
Date — 2025-05-24*

---

## 1 Context
The sandbox is developer-driven; runaway SageMaker instances or endpoints could exceed personal credit-card limits within a weekend.  
Project charter caps spend at **£40/month** and requires both a *human alert* and an *automatic stop*.

---

## 2 Decision
1. **AWS Budgets**  
   * Budget name `fraud-sbx-monthly`  
   * Limit **£40** → converted to USD using `fx_gbp_to_usd` variable for API compliance.  
   * Notifications at 30 %, 60 %, 90 % (ACTUAL) and 95 % (FORECAST).  
2. **SNS topic `fraud-budget-alerts`**  
   * KMS-encrypted; topic policy restricts publishers to `budgets.amazonaws.com` & `cloudwatch.amazonaws.com`.  
   * Two subscribers:  
     * **E-mail** — primary developer address (`alert_email` var).  
     * **Lambda** — automated kill-switch.  
3. **CloudWatch Billing Alarm**  
   * Name `fraud-sbx-billing-40gbp` in `us-east-1`.  
   * Fires at 100 % of the same GBP→USD threshold for near-real-time alerting.  
4. **Lambda `fraud-cost-kill`**  
   * Python 3.12, 128 MB mem, 30 s timeout.  
   * On invoke:  
     * `StopEndpoint` for every in-service SageMaker endpoint.  
     * `StopNotebookInstance` for every running notebook.  
   * DLQ (`sqs`), log group with 90-day retention.  
   * IAM role limited to the four SageMaker actions + CloudWatch Logs + DLQ send.  
5. **Pre-commit & CI enforcement** — `tfsec` / `Checkov` ensure encryption, least privilege; `infracost diff` shows £0 runtime cost for the guard-rail itself.

## 3 Consequences

### Positive
* Sandbox cannot exceed the £40 cap without at least three warnings (60 %, 90 %, 95 %) and an automatic compute shutdown.  
* Human gets an inbox alert; Lambda ensures action even if the e-mail is missed.  
* All pieces are IaC-managed; `make nuke` removes the budget, SNS, alarm, Lambda in one go.

### Negative
* Billing alarm only evaluates every 4–6 hours, so bursty spend could overshoot briefly.  
* Lambda covers endpoints & notebooks; future training jobs would need extra API calls.  
* Topic subscription confirmation is a manual step — onboarding docs must highlight it.

## 4 Alternatives considered
| Option                              | Why rejected                                                |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**      | ML-based but delays >24 h and no automatic shutdown hook.   |
| **Athena query + scheduled Lambda** | Flexible but reinvents Budgets logic and more moving parts. |
| **Third-party SaaS cost-watcher**   | Adds external billing data transfer and vendor risk.        |

---

## 5 Verification checklist
* **Budget test alert** ⇒ e-mail arrives and Lambda log shows “Stopping endpoint…”.  
* **CloudWatch alarm test** ⇒ same SNS topic triggers; budget & alarm share ARN.  
* `terraform destroy` ⇒ AWS Budgets console shows 0 budgets; SNS topic gone.  
* `tfsec` / `Checkov` ⇒ 0 HIGH severities.  
* Infracost PR comment ⇒ guard-rail resources cost **≈ £0.04/mo** (DynamoDB lock table).
