### ADR-0005 – **Baseline Transaction Schema (v0.1.0)**

*Status: Accepted — 25 May 2025*

---

#### 1  Purpose

Define the first-cut event schema that every downstream component (synthetic-data generator, feature store, model pipeline and realtime API) can rely on during Sprints 02-04.

---

#### 2  Context

* **Multi-timezone feed** – Card traffic arrives from several regions; local timestamps alone break “impossible-travel” rules.
* **Strict £50 / month cost-cap** – Any design that drags the repo into PCI scope (full PAN) would force paid tokenization services.
* **Solo developer** – Schema must be small enough to understand yet rich enough to showcase senior-level trade-offs.
* **Standards alignment** – We borrowed field ideas chiefly from ISO-8583, Mastercard MCC list, PCI-DSS QRG, public fraud sets (PaySim, Credit-Card-Fraud-2019).&#x20;
* **Future Feast compatibility** – Feast expects a primary key, an `event_time`, and snake\_case column names.

#### 3  Decision

*Versioning*

```yaml
version: "0.1.0"
```

The YAML file itself carries a semantic version header and is tagged in Git as `schema-v0.1.0`.

*Primary key & naming*

```yaml
transaction_id: string  # UUIDv4
```

All 24 fields are snake\_case; opaque UUID avoids PII collisions.

*Temporal layout*

```yaml
event_time: datetime  # RFC-3339 UTC
local_time_offset: int  # minutes −720…+840
```

One canonical UTC timestamp plus offset reproduces local wall-clock when needed.

*Money*

```yaml
amount: float
currency_code: string  # ISO-4217 e.g. "GBP"
```

*Card (PCI-safe)*

```yaml
card_pan_hash: string   # SHA-256
card_scheme: enum [VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, DISCOVER]
card_exp_year: int
card_exp_month: int
```

Only hashed PAN kept, keeping bucket outside PCI scope.&#x20;

*Parties*

```yaml
customer_id: int
merchant_id: int
merchant_country: string  # ISO-3166-alpha-2
mcc_code: int?            # nullable 4-digit MCC
```

*Channel / Device*

```yaml
channel: enum   [ONLINE, IN_STORE, ATM]
pos_entry_mode: enum [CHIP, MAGSTRIPE, NFC, ECOM]
device_type: enum [IOS, ANDROID, WEB, POS]
device_id: string?
ip_address: string   # IPv4
user_agent: string?
```

*Geo*

```yaml
latitude:  float
longitude: float
```

Values are country-centroid ±0.5° jitter for realism.

*Behaviour flags & links*

```yaml
is_recurring: bool
previous_txn_id: string?
```

*Label*

```yaml
label_fraud: bool
```

All non-optional fields are *NOT NULL*; optional columns model real-world sparsity (≈ 5-10 % nulls).

#### 4  Alternatives considered & rejected

| Area             | Option                        | Reason rejected                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identifier**   | 64-bit int sequence           | Needs central allocator, breaks multi-region ingest.      |
| **Time**         | Store local timestamp only    | Impossible to compare cross-zone events; DST errors.      |
| **Currency**     | Infer from `merchant_country` | Many merchants bill in foreign currency; high error rate. |
| **PAN handling** | Store first-6 + last-4        | Still quasi-PII; requires encryption & vault.             |
| **Location**     | Full 6-dp GPS                 | Looks fake in synthetic data; needless precision.         |

#### 5  Consequences

*Positive*

* ✅ Schema is outside PCI scope — simplifies AWS setup and cost.
* ✅ Feast-ready: primary key + event\_time already baked in.
* ✅ Enums & ISO codes keep string cardinality low for ML.
* ✅ Synthetic generator can map each column 1-to-1 to Faker/Mimesis providers, unblocking Sprint-02.

*Negative / risks*

* ⚠️ Hashing PAN removes ability to derive BIN ranges on the fly; must join to offline BIN table later.
* ⚠️ Latitude/longitude jitter ±0.5° may under-represent city-level fraud patterns; could tighten in v0.2.
* ⚠️ Only four `card_scheme` values – add UnionPay/JCB if Asian traffic grows.

---

#### 6  Implementation notes

* **Validation** – A pre-commit hook runs `yamllint` and `pytest tests/test_schema.py`, asserting:

  * exactly 24 columns,
  * all names snake\_case,
  * `currency_code` in ISO-4217 set,
  * enum values unique and upper-case.
* **Storage** – First parquet lands in `s3://fraud-sandbox-raw/v0.1.0/transactions.parquet`.
* **Migration path** – Future breaking changes bump minor version (`0.2.0`) and land in a parallel prefix to avoid back-fill headaches.

> **Snapshot statement**
> *“ADR-0005 locks the baseline event contract. It is Feast-compatible, PCI-minimal, and validated in CI, delivering Sprint-01’s ‘data schema designed and agreed’ exit criterion.”*
