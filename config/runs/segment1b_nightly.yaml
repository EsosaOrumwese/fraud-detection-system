# Segment 1B nightly run configuration
# Fill in the placeholder paths before scheduling this job.
# State coverage (after S6 implementation):
#   - S0 revalidates the 1A bundle for the manifest fingerprint.
#   - S1+S2 read/write under parameter_hash; S3 emits deterministic site counts.
#   - S4 publishes the allocation plan under data/layer1/1B/s4_alloc_plan/seed=…/fingerprint=…/parameter_hash=…/
#   - S5 emits s5_site_tile_assignment, RNG logs under logs/rng/events/site_tile_assign/, and a control-plane run report.
#   - S6 emits s6_site_jitter, RNG logs under logs/rng/events/in_cell_jitter/, and a control-plane run report.
#   - Control-plane artefacts (run reports, determinism receipts) live under control/<state>/… as per the dictionary.
