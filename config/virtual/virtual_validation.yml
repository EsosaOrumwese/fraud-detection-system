# Governed virtual validation tolerances derived from spec contracts:
# - ip_country_tolerance matches the 2% absolute error envelope enforced by virtual validation.
# - cutoff_tolerance_seconds follows the 23:59:59 ±5s settlement check.
ip_country_tolerance: 0.02          # allow up to 2 percentage points absolute deviation per country
cutoff_tolerance_seconds: 5         # settlement cut-off must fall within ±5 seconds of the target
notes: >
  Governed policy for 3B virtual validation; aligns with spec expectations (ip-country ±2pp, cut-off ±5s)
  and is sealed via S0 for downstream validation harnesses.
