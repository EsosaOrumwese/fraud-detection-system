# AGENT BRIEF - SCENARIO RUNNER

Purpose: Provide orchestration helpers used to drive end-to-end scenario runs against the data engine.

Guidance for future agents:
- Keep runners configurable via manifests and seeds.
- Delegate heavy lifting to layer orchestrators rather than re-implementing logic here.
- Capture telemetry hooks that validation relies on.
