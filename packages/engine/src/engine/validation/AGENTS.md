# AGENT BRIEF - VALIDATION

Purpose: Host shared validation utilities and bundles that prove runs are deterministic and contract compliant.

Guidance for future agents:
- Treat artefacts as read-only and raise explicit failures when contracts break.
- Keep checks deterministic and covered by regression tests.
- Reference the governing specs in docstrings for each validator.
