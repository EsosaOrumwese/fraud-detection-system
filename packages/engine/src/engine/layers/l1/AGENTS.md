# AGENT BRIEF - L1

Purpose: Implement Layer 1 (merchant and location realism) covering segments 1A through 3B.

Guidance for future agents:
- Follow the reading order in packages/engine/AGENTS.md before modifying this layer.
- Keep segment-specific helpers local to their segment folders.
- Record any new artefact dependencies in the relevant contracts directory.
