# AGENT BRIEF - S0 FOUNDATIONS L1

Purpose: Host the pure kernels that compute design vectors, eligibility markers, and manifest components for S0.

Guidance for future agents:
- Keep every function side-effect free and covered by fast unit tests.
- Accept typed inputs produced by L0 and emit simple data structures for L2.
- Reference the state spec when naming outputs so replay tooling recognises them.
