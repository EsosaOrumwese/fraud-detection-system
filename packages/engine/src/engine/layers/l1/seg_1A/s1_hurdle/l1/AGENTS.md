# AGENT BRIEF - S1 HURDLE L1

Purpose: Implement the pure logistic kernels that turn design vectors and coefficients into hurdle probabilities.

Guidance for future agents:
- Keep functions deterministic and free of IO.
- Accept numeric arrays from L0 and return probabilities with explicit typing.
- Provide unit tests covering edge cases such as extreme logits and clipping behaviour.
