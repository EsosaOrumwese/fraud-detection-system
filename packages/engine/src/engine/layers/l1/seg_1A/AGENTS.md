# AGENT BRIEF - SEGMENT 1A

Purpose: Execute Segment 1A states that turn merchant seeds into deterministic outlet counts and country sets (S0-S4).

Guidance for future agents:
- Build states in order and ensure each unlock passes the validation flow described in the specs.
- Share reusable kernels via the sublevel folders rather than cross-importing from other segments.
- Keep logging and lineage wiring consistent with the manifest fingerprint rules.
