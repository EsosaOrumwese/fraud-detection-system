# AGENT BRIEF - S4 ZTP TARGET L0

Purpose: Manage IO for the zero-truncated Poisson draw, loading cross-border hyperparameters and persisting sampled foreign country counts.

Guidance for future agents:
- Keep functions restricted to schema reads and writes; move math to L1.
- Track retry counts and cap enforcement so validation can audit the run.
- Align file paths with the contracts for country-set caches.
