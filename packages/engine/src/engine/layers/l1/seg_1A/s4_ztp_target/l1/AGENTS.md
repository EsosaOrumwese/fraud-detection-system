# AGENT BRIEF - S4 ZTP TARGET L1

Purpose: Implement the pure kernels that compute lambda parameters and perform ZTP sampling based on domestic counts and merchant attributes.

Guidance for future agents:
- Keep kernels deterministic aside from RNG inputs supplied by L2.
- Expose helper functions for computing lambda and probability mass for tests.
- Document any assumptions about cross-border features directly in the code.
