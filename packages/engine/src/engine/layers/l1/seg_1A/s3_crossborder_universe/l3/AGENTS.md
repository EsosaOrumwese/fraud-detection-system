# AGENT BRIEF - S3 CROSSBORDER UNIVERSE L3

Purpose: Validate eligibility outputs by replaying rule evaluation and confirming stored flags, reasons, and policy versions.

Guidance for future agents:
- Operate in read-only mode and raise failures with clear policy references.
- Check that manifest fingerprints match the governing policy artefacts.
- Keep validation deterministic for the replay bundle.
