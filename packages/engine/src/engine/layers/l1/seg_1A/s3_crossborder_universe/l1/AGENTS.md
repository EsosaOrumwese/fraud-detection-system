# AGENT BRIEF - S3 CROSSBORDER UNIVERSE L1

Purpose: Implement pure eligibility kernels that evaluate rule sets against merchant features and return structured reason codes.

Guidance for future agents:
- Encode policies declaratively and make kernels easily testable.
- Avoid side effects; produce plain data structures for L2.
- Reference policy document anchors in code comments for traceability.
