# AGENT BRIEF - S3 CROSSBORDER UNIVERSE L2

Purpose: Orchestrate eligibility evaluation by sequencing IO and kernels, ensuring only compliant merchants proceed to ZTP sampling.

Guidance for future agents:
- Maintain deterministic ordering and logging of rule outcomes.
- Short-circuit downstream processing for ineligible merchants.
- Record summary metrics that feed the validation layer.
