# AGENT BRIEF - LAYERS

Purpose: Organise all layer implementations; each child folder maps to a governed layer in the data engine.

Guidance for future agents:
- Create new layer folders only after the matching documentation and contracts are in place.
- Keep cross-layer utilities in core; this tree should only contain layer-specific code.
- Mirror the state naming conventions exactly so navigation stays aligned with the specs.
